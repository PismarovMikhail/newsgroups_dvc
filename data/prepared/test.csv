Within a few months, I'll be looking for a job in 3d computer graphics
software.  I'm in need of info on companies that do it.  There's nothing
in any of the FAQ's for this group, and nothing at siggraph.org (at least
I couldn't find anything.)  The last Computer Graphics Career Handbook was
dated 1991, had info on 40 companies, but nothing specific on any of them.

Can people please direct me towards more current and detailed sources of
information?  I'll post a summary of sources if there's interest.

Also, could you please e-mail me, our news server is on the fritz. :(

Thanks,
Brandon

There might be an IPAS routine that does that,but I can'r be sure.  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image.  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  It will
take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's
the only thing I can think of.

Yup.

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support
only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for
the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as
the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture
quality if your dithering works right).

I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to
GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.
You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA
card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+
computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a
8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write
some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other
colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg
dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette
the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would
when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but
it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way
gives a brighter more detailed image.

Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as
far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the
VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)

Have a day!

Gerry.

Corel Draw will do it; version 2 onwards. If you have version 1 perhaps an

Another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take PostScript.

well, i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering
them.  as for changing them back into negatives, is that really possible?
scanning and altering is no big deal. i don't know what types of
features you have in your version of photoshop.  but the one i use
(which, incidentally is on a quadra) has gallery effects and all types
of other neato stuff.
i'm just wondering why you would want to put your images back into
negatives, because once you print the image out-that's your print.
do you know what exactly your aim is in all of this?  like, are you
doing this just for fun, for a business, to gain more computer
knowledge, for a project you're working on....
otherwise, i guess i don't know if i'd be helping or not by posting info

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.
Some screens went completely (as above), others were just ""dodgy"".

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the
company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just
unlucky!

  A great many computer programmers read ""Dr. Dobb's Journal"".  In a recent
issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It
said:

  ""There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer
industry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's.""

  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the ""cracker"" ethic, which is something
entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the
free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is
it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to
have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person
like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,
crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any
useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely
ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to
make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves
hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact
that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so
for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a
volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller
than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the
corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the
286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  

  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of
innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud
it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative
systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the
problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for
blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.

  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,
where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves ""hackers""
allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,
interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the
computer industry?

  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.

:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very
:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know
:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]

Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark
recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view
given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'
is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.

I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider
themselves such.  Following is the definition from ""Jargon File 2.9.10"".
(This is also known as the ""Hackers Dictionary"".)  The definitions are
arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:

   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.
     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A
     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is
     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,
     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX
     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who
     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One
     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the
     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to
     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password
     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.

     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and
     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described
     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see
     {hacker ethic, the}).

     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an
     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new
     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego
     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled
     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.

   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing
     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of
     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and
     facilitating access to information and to computing resources
     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun
     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits
     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe
     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and
     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that
     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary
     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}
     project.

     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.
     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who
     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On
     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy
     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,
     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it
     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an
     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.

     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing
     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as
     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})
     can function without central control because of this trait; they
     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be
     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.

:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is

Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing
limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better
not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,
in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary
to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the
workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known
and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.

I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the promotion
of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method, 
procedures,algorythms,
applications, implementation, extensions of NAPLPS/JPEG standards.
These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online
applications that make use of Voice, Video, Telecommuting, HiRes 
graphics,
Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online order entry, Fax,in addition
these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML,CALS,
ODA,MIME,OODBMS,JPEG,MPEG,FRACTALS,SQL,CDrom,cdromXA,Kodak PhotoCD,TCL,
V.FAST,EIA/TIA562,can best be incorporated and implemented to
develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications....
 
We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2 
platforms.
It is our hope that individuals,developers, corporations, Universities,
R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.
 
This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already 
many
corporation have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so do not 
delay joining if you are a developer
 
An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be 
be compose to start promulgating what is known on the subject.
If you would like to be added to the mailist send email or mail to
the address below. 
 
This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG newsletter
as well as a hardcopy version.
We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications
& the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W,  decide to join and mutually benefit from 
this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.
 
NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage

Maybee you should persuade your burea that for only $650 they can become much
more competitive, taking input from Autocad, PostScript andGif as well as
SCODL... 

Seriously, this sounds like something the bureau should have. Or find another
bureau. You should not be the one buting this software.

Certainly. Reference follows. 

Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long
wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.

The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.
It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. 
Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.

On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red
corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31

Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.

So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?

This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on
the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is
very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.

*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia:

1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
4) This is the new chromaticity. 

The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications 8(5) 28-40.

You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.

>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow

>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!

Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and
the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or
obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago.

The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a
help here.)

A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data.
B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'
using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)
C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above
D) find the intersection as in step 3
E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A
F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it
along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and
white) until it is displayable.

Done; also posted for the rest of us.

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,
    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has
    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.

NeXT:

ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format
conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.
ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at
sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are
currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific
sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that
does not support JPEG.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

If you read the last couple of books in the series closely (well, #3 and #4
at least), there are at least two points at which the real Question is
implied.  Conversations proceed much like:

Zaphod: What *is* the ultimate Question, I wonder?
Arthur (not paying much attention to Zaphod, but needing a random seed for
  the Infinite Improbability Drive): Think of a number, any number.

Actually, it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and
everytime it's arranged such that ""Think of a number, any number"" could be
an answer to someone's question about the Question.

I kind of like it.  Very mystifying.  It's not even ""pick a number"" or
""tell me a number"", just ""think of one"".

Subject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)
Organization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand
Lines: 67

OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
(for better or for worse).

I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
switching.

A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
even more...

A good reason (which is why many companies use it) for 48 bits / pixel
is so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) - i.e. you have
2 * 24-bit planes. You write to the one in the background, and then FLIP! 
-- the entire screen updates to the second image-plane. The screen updates 
in one refresh and you don't see different objects appearing in the order 
that they're drawn (as in the CAD/MacDraw effect). Now your ready to update 
the image that used to be in the foreground.

About the SG product line: who can even keep track nowadays? Every co. seems
to (as their ads / press releases claim) redefine computing (etc. etc.) as
we know it with each new product. Progress and competition are great, but who
wants to invest in a system that's obsolete by the time it reaches your desk?

I'm also interested in such a program. But most of all I'd like to know 
wich program is able to convert GIF or PCX to DXF !!! When I have this 
program, I can scan pictures and frase (or something like that !) them.
This will be beyond the limit !!!

I've tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 2.22.  After
fixing up a few bugs (3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
other things) I got it to compile & link, but after starting client
& server I just get a black window; sometimes the client core dumps,
sometimes the server, sometimes I get a broken pipe, sometimes it
just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the
cursor to become a cross-hair in dog-fight, but that's it.  I've
sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week, but
no reply as yet.

    I do not know if I am hitting the right news groups or not, any help in
the right direction is more than welcome.  I need help finding a company
that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by Adobe Photoshop
and turn them into thermal prints or negatives.  I am looking for a place
as close to North Carolina as possible.  The images will be created on
a Macintosh Quadra 800 running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored in
whatever format the vendor requires, perhaps 88M cartridges?

    The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpi
scanner then modified/corrected by Adobe Photoshop.  If anyone could help me
or even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful.

    Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear
from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you
use and/or any peripherals or software.  It seemed the Quadra 800 would be
my best bet to modify photographic images.  I am planning on buying a Quadra
800 with 32Megs of RAM, a 510Meg Hard Drive, a 1200 dpi scanner, 17"" Sony 
monitor and a 88Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM.  I am new to
computers and any advice would be great.

photograph of the entire earth, with cloudcover removed.  I just think
it's really cool.  It was created with government funds and sattelites

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which
includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen. 

Hope this helps.

This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version
of a mac file so the Resource fork and Data fork get preserved.
You need a program that converts this to a regular file. If this is a
macbinary file, you may have downloaded it in Text mode and is probably
corrupt (if you did). If you're using FTP to transfer it at any point make sure
you type ""binary"" first.

If you can open the file with a text editor and find
(This file must be converted with Bin....
at the top, it is a BinHex file and can be decoded with
BinHex 4.0 (among other programs).

Subject: Raytracing Colours?
Keywords: raytracer colours realism vectors
Organization: Computer Science Department, University of Cape Town
Lines: 25

I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.

When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first
the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln 
where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light
rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and
the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.

Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 
along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own
colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).

The question is: 
  How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get
  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?

All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components
between 0 and 1.

If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?

Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw.  I personally like
Arts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters
that CorelDraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  I haven't found the perfect
graphics program that does everything yet.  

My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different
formats.  Arts & Letters does not.  I like the thousands of clipart
available with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up
in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.

One of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on
the market for the artistically deprived :-).

Well, I am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several
polygonal descriptions of a head, face, skull, vase, etc. The format
of the files is a list of vertices, normals, and triangles. There are
various resolutions and the name of the data file includes the number
of polygons, eg. phred.1.3k.vbl contains 1300 polygons.


In order to get the data via ftp do the following:

	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil
	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password
	3) cd pub/dabro
	4) binary
	5) get cyber.tar.Z

Once you get the data onto your workstation:

	1) uncompress data.tar.Z
	2) tar xvof data.tar

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Please help.

I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I
was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,
which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and
all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.

I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was
completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still
worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what
was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.

I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still
tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,
all to no avail.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I
need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the
""death"" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the
net about this because I already know what they'll say: ""Yep, you gotta have
this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???.""

I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life
cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the
brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.
I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down
before coming in to work today.

If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not
opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely
necessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu
but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.

BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel
free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and
name of the FAQ if you don't mind.

Exactly...

I didn't want to mess with tga or rle.  So I wrote the following script. 
All you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities. 

This script is a .pov to .jpg converter.  Just run it like this:

  pov2jpg 1280 1024 fred.pov 

You will need to modify the path's in the script to reflect where you put
povray and its include files.  If you have a problem with disk space, you
can use named pipes instead of temporary files.

I hope you find it useful...

I had it return random colours instead and everything worked great (except for a few colour problems) so I know its the only thing wrong.

The colour table somehow gets a couple of nulls placed in it so when the ""name"" of the colours are compared it crashes.  I haven't found the problem yet maybe someone else can.

Now I have a couple raytracing questions.
Just so you know I'm using PovRay 1.0 (both MS-dos and Unix) and I'm generating Targa files of varying size.

1) ok, so I can view these wonderful pictures on my screen.  What's the best way  to get them on to paper?  Would it be possible to take it to Kinko's and have   them make an actual picture on paper from it?

2) I was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced 
frames.  Is this a bad idea?  Any tricks to it?

 How would I get a sequence of targa files made into an animation

Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed
my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.
It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:

   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge
   2) one's financial situation takes precedence
   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)
   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from ""fun"" to ""work""
   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for ""the hobby""

or the biggest killer (IMO)

   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's
      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without
      the motivation the effort seems useless.

Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember
when there were several completely different computer systems, our children
are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy
the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early
eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems
that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely
divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new
systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was
needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a
commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being
taught the ""user"" mentality.  As the number of us ""old-timers"" dwindle we are
not being replaced by the next generation.

	Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will 
	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant
	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see 
	fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist
	of filtering the image through their favorite paint
	program.  For ""analog"" artists, this may well be
	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their
	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan-
	ning in the image again to be transferred on to 
	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works
	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.

	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin
	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think 
	it takes to finish up the image they've been given
	using whatever technique they see as worthy.  
	These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.

Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain
surfaces for exactly the purpose you require, importing into 3D
modelling packages. Be warned, the data content is high and brings
many packages to their knees. We use it primarily for MicroStation
but it exports DXF, as well as other formats, so you should be OK.
You can get it from my FTP mirror site in the US.

	Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's 
	Contest Announcement)

WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?

ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer 
peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that 
uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to 
a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or 
keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR 
gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and 
others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications 
such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, 
Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more 
can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts 
Plug and Play on every PC.

The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of 
systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host 
computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a 
number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 
development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-
platform use of the same device.

ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:
=====================================

ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone 
to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 
fee or royalty.
ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single 
host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus 
data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.

ACCESS.bus Physical Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware 
protocol, with one data line and one clock line.
Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level 
handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock 
synchronization.  

ACCESS.bus Software Protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three 
levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.

I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines 
arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C 
provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 
different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, 
framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the 
receiver.  

BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 
a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the 
ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an 
ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with 
additional semantics, including checksum.
Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot 
plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus 
addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot 
plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 
system is running, without rebooting.

APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus 
protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 
types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application 
Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: 
keyboards, locators, and text devices.

ACCESS.bus support on the PC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the 
PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the 
base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  
An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 
- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with

Subject: HELP: A rectangle and parallelogram

I hope someone can help me with the following problem - I'm sure there
must be a known solution.

Given a rectangle defined by

-X <= x <= X  and -Y <= y <= Y  where X and Y are constant

and a parallelogram defined by

-C1 <= a*x + b*y <= C1  and -C2 <= c*x + d*y <= C2

where C1, C2, a, b, c, d are constants and b/a != d/c (i.e. not
parallel lines)                                ^^
                                          not equal to

what is the area of their intersection?

   What I'm after is some general algorithm suitable for ALL rectangles
and parallelograms that can be described by the above equations.  At the 
moment it looks like I'm going to have to look at all possible cases 
and examine each seperately e.g.

1) rectangle encloses parallelogram. 

2) parallelogram encloses rectangle.

3) two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle

Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics 
that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few 
important parameters. 
The polygons are all convex. 
They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave / self intersecting polygons. 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 
number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.

Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons.

It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms.
If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons
I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a 
asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.

  In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little
programs. One is a C program that will perform a ""morph"" between
any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then
it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out
to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions
and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would
let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply
performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know
an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there 
must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because
I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However
this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is 
appreciated.

ROME REBORN:  THE VATICAN LIBRARY AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE
presents some 200 of the Vatican Library's most precious
manuscripts, books, and maps--many of which played a key role in
the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of Greece and
Rome.  The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican
Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson
Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through
April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by
anonymous FTP indefinitely.

     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican
Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &
Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came
to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each
section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit
directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit
includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,
but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if
there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items
omitted later in the planning process.

     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance
scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of
science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the
humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,
theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and
to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the
README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If
you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local
computer support person.  If you have questions or comments about
the CONTENT of the exhibit, please write to vatican@kell.loc.gov
while if you have any questions or comments on the SYSTEM please

G'day Brian,

I'll be blunt about this. The ONLY reasonable explanation of Roberts
algorithm is in

Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics
Rogers
McGraw-Hill Book Co. 1985

Go to the library and look at this.

There is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition
of Newman and Sproull.

The algorithm described in PECG runs in near linear time.

Luck,

Dave Rogers

I'm having a slight problem with the POV raytracer.  I'm not sure if
this is the correct group to post to or not.  I create .tga files on
a unix machine using pov.  Then when i download them to display on my pc,
they're listed as bad files.  But when I create the file on my pc, it displays
fine.  Are unix .tga's incompatible with the pc?  An easy solution to this
problem would be a unix targa->gif converter.  Anyone know where I could
find one?  Any help on this subject is appreciated.

I have posted DISP140.ZIP to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.
I will upload this package to SIMTEL20 later.

******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use
         if no fee is gained.
******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any
         damage caused by this program.

Important changes since Version 1.35:
  Added support for IRIS.
  Support Mix/Concat. two images.
  Added support for 'batch conversion'.
  Added support for 'load/save palette table'.
  Added support for 'edge enhance'.
  Added support for 'crop one line'.
  Added support for 'negate image'.
  New color quantization option.
  Fix some minor bugs.

(1) Introduction:
  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)
  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts.
  Include simple file management system.
  Support 'slide show'.
+ Support 'batch conversion'.
  There is NO LIMIT on image size.
  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.
  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).


(2) Hardware Requirement:
  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.
  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).
  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).
  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.

  Supported Wares:

  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)
  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping
  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768
  * 80387
  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies
  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX

  Unsupported:

  * DPMI
  * Microsoft Windows

  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory
  model, SVGA graphics.


(3) Installation:
  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.
  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)
  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version)
  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with
      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,
      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.

  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.

  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment
    GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256

  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387

  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
                 Other drivers are not tested.
              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits
                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.
                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.
              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,
                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).
                 You can find vesa BIOS driver from :

(7) Detail:

   Initialization:
      Set default display type to highest display type.
      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy
      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
      The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".
        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file.
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is.
        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check
        standard extension. Still fail, report error.
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.
        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
          (except ESCAPE).
        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.
+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.
        ESCAPE to terminate.
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.
+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.
        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,
     COMMENT about this program,
     Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
     I need your suggestion to improve this program.
     (There is NO anonymous ftp on this site)


(8) Tech. information:
  Program (user interface and some subroutines) written by Jih-Shin Ho.
  Some subroutines are borrowed from XV(2.21) and PBMPLUS(dec 91).
  Tiff(V3.2) and Jpeg(V4) reading/writing are through public domain
    libraries.
  Compiled with DJGPP.
  You can get whole DJGPP package from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.
    For example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp


(9) For Thoese who want to modify video driver:
   1. get GRX source code from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.
   2. For HiColor and TrueColor:
        15 bits : # of colors is set to 32768.
        16 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc010.
        24 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc018.


Acknowledgment:
  I would like to thank the authors of XV and PBMPLUS for their permission
    to let me use their subroutines.
  Also I will thank the authors who write Tiff and Jpeg libraries.
  Thank DJ. Without DJGPP I can't do any thing on PC.

On a more cheerful note, perhaps hackerism/hacking isn't completely dead.

As someone else said, take the GNU offerings for example - free, redistributable and 
often better than the commercial stuff.  Take also the number of papers published
every year in all the fields of computer science - the vast majority of these papers
detail original work of real, often exceptional merit - and the authors are sharing

PEXLIB and PHIGS (as it comes from MIT with PEX and as is explained in the
PHIGS Programming Manual) are just different API's for the PEX protocol,
which is an extension to the X protocol.

So it depends on You, what you go to use.

Advantage of Phigs is the protability to other platforms (IBM GraPhigs, 
SunPhigs) and the standardized structuring of the 3D objects.

Advantage of PEXlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for
immediate mode graphics, because PEX is not an exactly mapping of Phigs
to a Prortocol.

Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that
needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg
24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.

The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.
And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90%
quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything
else even an 8bit gif!

	What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much
it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's
hardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple,
DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's
hardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about
dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for
dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers
seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and
cheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer
years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386
and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.

	What's really interesting is that from what I can tell, the MIS
folks in the basement with their ES/9000 don't seem to be pissed at IBM.
Why?  I have no idea.  Either IBM really does take care of their customers
better, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the
smaller vendors do.

We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place
in Tel-Aviv university. We have two databases that we are currently working
on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated 
and ones that will give prettier images.

Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are 
going to present a paper titled ""Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains""
which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS'93 
conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape 
with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be 
presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.

We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, 
and terrain elevation maps (DTM). 
Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can
be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can
be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can
also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.

If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such
data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us
directly :

amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), or
danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)

Of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be

You can use PBM's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw (r, g, b) files to pgm format. Then you can use pgm3toppm to convert the pgm files to a composite ppm file,

[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that
making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates.]

In reverse order:

1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then
click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you
look carefully.

2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette
entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must
save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it
saves out 8 bit images - of course!

XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy
facility, not a bug.

How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group
'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done
unless the software were very different and much more complicated.

If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull
software - which is readily available commercially.

And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of
arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space
;-)

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by
Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be
read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has
a built in compression scheme (LZW?).

IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package
images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was
created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.
It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.
The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved
BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.

Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats
(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)

	The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece
of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the
outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously
suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I
suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline
very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines
(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most
common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and
tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of
the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive
algorithm that would let you step in and say ""no, dummy, you're going the
wrong way"".

	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his
doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).
A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized
micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.
This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with
its auto-trace tool.

	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he
was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a
good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future
analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem
since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the
virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be
restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,
clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real
life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult
this problem is to solve in the general case.

	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while
on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last
known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no
bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some
sort of fall or accident in the woods.

Hmm... 48 bit aye?
Well, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance.
48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.
The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it
as 65536 possible shades of pure red.
This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) 
may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.
Then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way 
of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program
code.

	Take care,

I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say
my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most
obvious thing.
Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,
please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just
refered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make
hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.

It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
and don't understand include previously written material with the new
sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.

You also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what
is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply
to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know
that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.

XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the
places you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I
wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?

Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives;

No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts
of their budget allocated ""upgrades"", ""maintenance"", and ""new purchases"",
and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually ""leases"" and so
is the software.

Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and
designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a 
Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types
upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and
depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies
the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,
payroll, etc.

Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some
reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every
engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)

Howdy...  I think you would be interested in Infini-D 2.5 for the Mac.  There
is no DOS or Windows version.  It's quite an amazing program.

""Some"" of the features:

*  Bevel Text
*  Timeline based animation sequencer
*  Realtime bounding box preview
*  Object linking
*  Phong Shading
*  Ray Tracing
*  Bounding Box shading
*  Wireframe shading
*  Ghourad shading
*  Flat shading
*  Anti-aliasing (none, low, medium, high)
*  Environment maps
*  Quicktime support (wrap a QT movie around an object)
*  Procedural surfaces
*  Composed surfaces (for layering surfaces)
*  Alpha channel support
*  Import EPS, DXF, and Swivel 3D files
*  Export DXF and Swivel 3D files
*  Spline based animation
*  Animation assistant (for creating smooth movements and other stuff)
*  Object morphing (surfaces and bevels morph too)

... And lots more that I can't remember right now...

Anyway, it's not as expensive as some of the other animation/rendering
packages.  I think you can get it for around $699 from MacWarehouse.
They also have educational discounts...

Well, hope that helps a bit.

See ya...

This is a heavily edited/modified version of the Gopher FAQ intended to
give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a
client and jump into Gopher-space - a complete version can be obtained
as described below.  Once you have a gopher client point it at 
merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space!

Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a
client/server protocol for making a world wide information service,
with many implementations.  Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, 
comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.

The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or
via anonymous ftp:

rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq

Those without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body to find out
how to do FTP by e-mail.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
List of questions in the Gopher FAQ:

Q0:  What is Gopher?
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher?
Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?
Q7: What is veronica?
Q8: What is Available for Biology?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q0:  What is Gopher?

A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed
     information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide
     information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While
     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher
     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers
     throughout the world. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?

A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory
     /pub/gopher

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?

A2:  You will need a gopher ""client"" program that runs on your local PC
     or workstation

     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory
     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory
     /pub/gopher.

      Unix Curses & Emacs   :  /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z
      Xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z
      Xwindows (Motif)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/moog
      Xwindows (Xview)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher
      Macintosh Hypercard   :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions *
      Macintosh Application :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher *
      DOS w/Clarkson Driver :  /pub/gopher/PC_client/
      NeXTstep              :  /pub/gopher/NeXT/
      VM/CMS                :  /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/
      VMS                   :  /pub/gopher/VMS/
      OS/2 2.0	            :  /pub/gopher/os2/
      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/

     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the
     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  

      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client ""The Gopher Book""
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip

      A Macintosh Application, ""MacGopher"".
        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *

      Another Macintosh application, ""GopherApp"".
        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *

      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP
        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe

      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS
     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe

      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace
      for DOS
         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher

      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX
         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE


     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.

     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:

       Type=1
       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu
       Port=70
       Path=
       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.

 
     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and
     look in the gopher directory.


     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.
     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine
     ""consultant.micro.umn.edu"" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more
     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client
     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A
     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,
     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to
     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?

A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize
     network lag.

     Telnet Public Logins:

     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area
     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------
     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America
     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America
     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America
     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe
     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia
     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden
     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America
     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador
     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan


     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of
     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the
     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)
     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features
     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file
     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp
     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?

A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University
     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  

     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information
     System used by a large number of sites in the world.

     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to
     count. 

     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:
   
      Internet Gopher Developers
      100 Union St. SE #190
      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA

     Or via FAX at:
 
      +1 (612) 625-6817

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?

A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.
     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: 
     
       - Search local WAIS indices.
       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?

A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7: What is veronica?

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to 
     Computerized Archives.

     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles
     in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica 
     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher
     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.
     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy
     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the
     gopher protocol.

     To try veronica, select it from the ""Other Gophers"" menu on 
     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:

     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) 
     Type=1 
     Port=70 
     Path=1/veronica 
     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q8: What is Available for Biology?

I opened the file with a text editor and it looks like:

I have already tried BinHex which does not seem to work. 
Any other ideas?

According to the literature, it will do quadruple buffering so that you
can have double buffered stereo output.

Subject: virtual sound
Keywords: virtual sound, surround sound
Organization: Institutt for Informatikk UIB Norway
Lines: 31

I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is
the following;

From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having
it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the
listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some
reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  

Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? 

Please post or mail any answers or comments.

We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also
shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by
about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only
1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What
is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due
mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is
more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at
different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the
stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon
right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see
a smeared effect where they overlap.
  Example:
  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)
      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)

Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when
rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces
with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as
you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the
system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the
application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.
Bravo!

(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed
through proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)

Dear Prospective Employer:

I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software
design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware, 
C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and
computer networking.

I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics
Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992 
from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer
Engineering at Iowa State University.

During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have
published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.
These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability
to learn new concepts quickly.

I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and
have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level. 
I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS.
I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant,
am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform 
GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems
and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the
study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating
system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in
computer networking.

While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication.
I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I
have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and
have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.

My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics
Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.
I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. I would like to
have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals. 
I am eager to hear from you soon.


Sincerely

Both xli and xloadimage will display in 24 bit color if a 24 bit visual

Does anyone truely understand the ""INVALID NORMAL ARRAY"" error 3ds gives
you while rendering?  It seems to present itself while rendering
complicated images.  I have circumvented this problem by rendering at
the command line, however it would be nice to render inside the editor.
Is this a memory problem???

Maybe. I've had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is
still used daily and the screen on that is fine. The only problem it
has (and ever has had) is the ""arm"" of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it
round a bit. But other than that, it's been perfect! So what's that,
about um, 60 months???!

Hello,

We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system
(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must 
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  
At this point, X11 graphics is not an option.

This graphics program should, if possible, support these
sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):

   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly
      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)
      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	
  
   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color
      plotting were available, if the output device
      supported it.

We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but
gnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot.

At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems.  If you have any information, please
contact me at the above email address.  If the product you know
about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number
or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.

There are several CRT-to-film writers around. Agfa has some, they also might
be called Matrix?, and I am pretty sure other companies sell the same
equipment. You might want to talk to any company in your area that does
presentation slides or offers graphics services. They should have those
machines and they might point you to a local vendor. From there on it's all
a question of money. They units are essentially high res CRTs plus a filter
wheel plus a 35mm camera and a computer hook-up.

Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They
can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model, the
RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not
idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They
still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

Maximum Strategy, Inc.
801 Buckeye Court
Milpitas, CA 95035-7408
sales@maxstrat.com

You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate.

Interesting problem. Tell us more if you can?

Yes.  Here's what you should do.

Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,
but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into
the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each
vertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex
more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the
polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have
to be transformed at all.

Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither
plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.

Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their
projection done at that stage.

Does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling, but not both

Same question again, does this mean they can either do double

Don't mind if I do.
As someone who would _love_ to see XV go to 24 bit, this
would be plenty for me.

    a) XV can Load a 24 bit image, and display it in all it's
24 bit glory on 24 bit X displays.
    b) All other operations (Crop, Dither, Smooth, etc.) are not
supported on 24 bit images.

how hard would this be?

This image is copyrighted. Early in another news group it was being

I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library 
package to do PC VGA graphics.  

I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a 
non-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics.  I'm not sure if 
reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.  
I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that 
handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.  If this 
provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can 
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library.  

Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something,
what do you think?

Does anyone have any real experience with the Kubota Kenai/Denali
series of graphics workstations?  They pretty much blow the pants
off SGI machines and Sun machines in the same price point, which
is about 50,000 bucks.  Real nice stuff, but I've only seen the
stuff on paper.  I'm wondering, is there anything NOT to like?  The
specs are too massive to get into here, but if a summary is desired
I could be coaxed into uploading the spec sheet.

Actually, IFF is a *format standard*.  It is not a picture file format, sound
file format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard.  The
IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM).
The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and
it's predecessor, Turbo Silver.   It is possible that some of the other Amiga
packages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any.  Lightwave will load
TDDD FORM's I believe.

Originator: abrodnik@watdragon.uwaterloo.ca
Organization: Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia
Lines: 69

This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.
The first fully international issue has been published and echoes 
are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). 

Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993

Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 
will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured
in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page
-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited
part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for
knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);
and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views
into the discourse.
   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page
expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other
concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,
mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology 
(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this
page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express
their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question.
   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.
The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional 
achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on
one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should
be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the 
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.
   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation
right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.
A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.
   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)
and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.
You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.
On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual
reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing
in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.
   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.
You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete
papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received
several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,
Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed
texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact
person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job.

At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,
and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give
proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail
and by other means.

Sincerely yours,

hi netters,

	I'm doing a project which is about image analysis.  Firstly, I
have to find out any restrictions or limitations on the colour display
on various kind of workstations, they are DECstation, HP, Amiga, Apollo.

	Secondly, I read from some graphic texts that image is displayed
in 24 bites(please point out to me if I got it wrong).  But, the images
which I will deal with are displayed in 16 bites by the software they
are using currently.  So, will there be any problems to display them
under X-windows in the future? Because we are thinking to implement the
GUI by X-windows for our project


	Is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or

them out. 

	Please send me an e-mail if there are any.  Thanks in advance.

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

  Check with:
	Natural Graphics
	P.O. Box 1963
	Raklin, CA 95677
	Phone (916) 624-1436

  Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:

        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:
   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics
   1600 Indiana Ave.
   Winter Park, FL 32789
   Phone: (407) 384-9484
   FAX: (407) 647-7242

b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.
   Written by Steve Worley.

[ What about Texture City ?? ]

==========================================================================

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]

========================================================================

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

========================================================================

IRIS Explorer
-------------
  It's an application creation system developed by Silicon
  Graphics that provides visualisation and analysis functionality for
  computational scientists, engineers and other scientists. The Explorer
  GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write
  any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can
  be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently
  is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on
  other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as
  I know]

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

  For a free WIT demo disk, call, FAX, or e-mail (poon@ee.ubc.ca)

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a ""Brick of Bytes"", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level
  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send
  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,
  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass
  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send
  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

MAP II
------
  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.

CLRview

I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
will do compositing of a series of pictures?

What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip
(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to
composite a series of frames would be even better.

I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform
this.  Help, please!

Organization: University of Houston

Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu


   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,
   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.
   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,
   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,
   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.

   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)

NAME
   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations

DESCRIPTION
  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on
  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both
  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.

  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their
  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the
  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using
  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The
  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed
  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.

  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and
  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss
  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing
  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type
  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of
  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into
  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple
  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with
  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take
  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).

  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing
  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence
  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be
  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image
  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-
  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically
  giving great flexibility in processing an image.

FEATURES

  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a
  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, 
  the processed image will be displayed.

  Current features include

  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing
    and filling the ""rotated out"" region with an arbitrary color.

  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with
    the option of subpixel sampling.

  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an
    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving
    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to
    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text
    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as
    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha
    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.

  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.

  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation
    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary
    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels
    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of
    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished
    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-
    lability of graphical histograms of the image.

  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-
    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at
    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some
    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering
    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,
    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions
    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a
    circle).

  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-
    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.

  o Performs histogram equalization.

  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of
    arbitrary order.

  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.

  o Cuts and pastes across images.

  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.

  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause
    interval between images. (SlideShow)

  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels
    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities
    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.

  o Performs image type conversions.

  o Converts image formats.

  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).

  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image
    back and display it.

  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.

  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the
    resulting power spectra.

  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).

 SUPPORTED FORMATS
      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS
      o  JPEG(JFIF) format
      o  CompuServ GIF
      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.
      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)
      o  TIFF
      o  PostScript(Write only)

Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the
code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms.
NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,
NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you
wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you
use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that
SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just
implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well
thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement
it.

If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently
getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well
enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going
on a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get
a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is
what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.
thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,
etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.
Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that
not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.

In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing
running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.
At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should
'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -
and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.

(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.
And I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)

Has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?
I have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but
that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I

I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed.
We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.

So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there
must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway,
and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place.

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image
back to 24 bit image.


>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>>much more complicated.

Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,
jumps off the discussion a bit.

My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit
image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.


About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image.
XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images.

Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global
changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job.
If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the
original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit
image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --
selecting individual color is possible from that.

Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention
24bit painting program in 8bit screen...


>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
designed for that.
Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,
person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work -- design error.

I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
major change to the original design.

So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,
even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.
(Americans: the lift is just an example :)


Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to
read it.

	Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with

	very successful file format.  People seem perfectly capable
	dealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF
	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and
	FAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries
	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather
	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.

	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather
	simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest
	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.

	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about

	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would
	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,
	but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).
	JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.

	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle
	all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.
	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging

Subject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together
Organization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA)
Keywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas
Lines: 84

I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different
PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any
resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's
_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).

I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the
same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on
comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,
hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and
are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in
comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach
to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above
Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)

The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize ""stitching""
artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are
coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will
differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values
across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the
Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.
Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the
line is supposed to be solid.

Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one
for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-
mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The
result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to
attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.

This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair ""backwards"" (i.e.
smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view
table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed
to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.

I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,
typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).
Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC
between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
the stitching.

But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003
to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z
component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more
or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the
Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one
problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines ""show through""
areas which they are supposed to lie behind.

I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital
workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test
program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;
this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX
5.1.

Open questions:
    (1) Why does this happen?
        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?
        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines
            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which
            could be corrected for?
        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their
            interpolators?
        --  Something else?
    (2) What to do about it?
        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
            in Z-buffered HLHSR?
        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching
            artifacts?
        --  Am I just out of luck?

Any help would be immensely appreciated!

Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode
rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that
it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.

The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful
options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that
rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently
in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on
all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared
to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --
again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored
by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also
note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably
compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that
none of the FAX formats are really useful.

What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,
e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have
provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses
bytes rather than pixels.

But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register
proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.
This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably
read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.

Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven't actually used one
or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see
an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or
something.

Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that
run OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are
binary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali
is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding ""transformation engines"".

The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation
and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.

Okay, now the real stuff.  The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
known as Denali.  The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V.  They
use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz.  Their

As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part
is the pricing.  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information.
Their number is 408-727-8100.  I'm sure they'll send you an information you
may want.  Oh, some prices:

Low-end

Kenai 3400, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 27,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 45,345 dollars U.S.

High-end

Kenai 3400, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 61,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 79,345 dollars U.S.

If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or
something I would appreciate it.

Hope this helps someone out there,

   Hey,

   I am looking for C-algorithm, which decide,whether a 3D-Point is
   inside a space which was defined by 8 x 3D-points.
   With a space defined by 8 x 3D-points, I mean a space defined by
   6 closed 3D meshes defined by 8 points. Like this :

              _____
             /    /|
            /____/ |
            |    | |
            |    | /
            |____|/


   But in this simple example, the sides are parallel, but my problem,
   the sides can be non parallel and the opposite sides must not have
   the same size etc. Please mail me your informations !

   Thanks for your great efforts

      Oliver

Illustrator for SGI is a shipping product. Adobe and SGI have announced that  
Photoshop is being ported to SGI machines. A simillar announcement has been  
made by Adobe and Sun for Sun platforms. No dates have been announced to the  
best of my knowledge.

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to
many newsgroups.

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.

Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications
in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.


>And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any

Never claimed it is a bug.
I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than
a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.
(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
places so far.)

You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

Or alternatively, 75% of the questions cover 10% of the topics in this group -

So the other 25% cover 90% of the topics, making them rarely asked and thus in

I was at an Adobe seminar/conference/propaganda forum/whatever-you-want-to-
call-it a couple months ago where they announced that Display Postscript was
going to be included in the next release of Sun's OS, (presumably Solaris.)
Sun was going to drop their development of Newsprint, and, in return for this,
Adobe was going to port Illustrator and Photoshop to Sun.  Other than the
articles that appeared in the trade journals immediately after, I haven't
heard a peep about it.  I hope it's still in the works.

   OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
   the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

   First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
   realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
   (for better or for worse).

   I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
   ""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
   frames.

   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
   ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
   switching.

   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
   even more...

I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that
can significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take
into account:

(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a
movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16
bit, but other depths are (of course) possible).

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for ""double size"" scaling, other scaling
factors hit peformance much harder).

(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices
to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).

Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size
is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also
make a real difference.

Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...

Usually, you apply

[R]    [ 1     0        1.402   ][Y]
[G] =  [ 1  -0.34414   -0.71414 ][U]
[B]    [ 1    1.772     0       ][V]


after unlevelshifting U and V (subtracting 128 from them).

This matrix multiplication may give results out of RGB space, so you
have to clamp the resulting bytes to [0..255].
The conversion should be done with arbitrary big integers, not floats :)

This applies to YUV data whereas NTSC may have YIQ where a 33 degree
rotation to U/V is buid in.

Or perhaps you write a freely available, GPLed unix for commonly
available computer platforms (i386/i486 machines) and become a catalyst
for a major netwide project which produces a better unix-like os than
many commercial counterparts (see comp.os.linux for details).  Or maybe
you found a Legue for Programming Freedom to fight restrictive litigation
and software patenting practices, thereby protecting the creative freedom
so vital to continuing progress in our field.  Or maybe you start up
a gnu project, and produce by far and away the best c/c++ compiler
for unix there is, not to mention other valuable utilities.

Some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their
ideals.  As for Bill Gates, after pawning of grossly inferior software
onto the PC market for ten years, if he ever was a hacker, he deserves
to have his name eradicated from the Annals of Computer Hackery.

As for me, I like running linux+X+countless other packages, without
paying a dime.  On the other hand, I have no problem purchasing motif
or other good software, as long as Microsoft hasn't fouled it with their
inept input.

My 2 cents worth, flames will be patiently ignored. :-)

The alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes:
1. For groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official'
  hierarchies
2. For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like alt.gulf.war

Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities,
sites are free to decide not to carry (some of) the alt groups.

Therefore, it is (I think) desirable to try to create comp.graphics.
{raytrace, rendering or whatever} and not an alt-group

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 
Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look
rather odd.

So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:

>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>much more complicated.

>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much
>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.

In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.
Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.

As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If
that was not what you meant, then:

>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
>places so far.)

Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry
if I misunderstood.

>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

The problem is that the process is inherently complicated ! The IJG's code is
pretty good if you ask me, and I have watched it go through many many cycles of
revision.

Try getting a good book on the subject, that will explain the algorithms.

Specifically ""JPEG Still Image Compression Standard"" by Pennebaker & Mitchell,
VNR 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.

BTW. I presume your comment about ""good"" code wasn't meant to sound as offensive
as it does.

    Hi folks,

I'm doing an animated film on new methodes in loom
research (You know, the thing they make cloth with.)
and need a model of a loom. The format should be 
in ascii faceted geometry and fairly straight
forward to figure out. Any help or pointers would be
greatly appreciated.

-Thanks

Hi! Everyone,

I don't clearly understand 'occlusion' in computer graphics.
Would you please give me an explanation?

BTW, what's the difference between 'occluded surface' and opaque surface?

Thanks in advance.

This file is crossposted to comp.graphics, comp.answers and news.answers,
so if you can't locate it in comp.graphics, you're advised to search in
comp.answers or news.answers
(The latter groups usually are archived in your site. Contact your sysadmin
for more info).

These 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in
many places (see below)

--

Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site
pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory
pub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears
in the Archive-name line at the top of the article.
This FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]

There's a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to
mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field

--

The inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the
Subject 4: Mail servers )

--

The Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine
enuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list.
It's got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of
indexing.

Yet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH
(Swiss Academic and Research Network) system in Switzerland:

interactive:
  telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as ""info"". Move to the
  info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory. Search in the
  00index file by typing ""/"" and the word to look for.
  You may then just read the FAQ in the ""faqs"" directory, or decide
  to fetch it by one of the following methods.

ftp:
  login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and
  enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a
  password.

	cd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings

mail:
  send e-mail to

Enter 'help' in the bodypart to receive instructions. No information
is required in the subject header line.


1. ARCHIE
=========

The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for
requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie
before asking help in the newsgroups.

Archie servers:
  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)
  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)
  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)
  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)
  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)
  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)
  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)
  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)
  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])
  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])
  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])
  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])
  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type ""archie"" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as
the username.)

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.


+RED
+---
+  RED - Listserv Redirector is essentially a mail server.
+  The Server Sites that are available are:
+

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

BBSes

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word
  ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

==========================================================================

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),
  e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or

Hi,
  I need to know if there is a 256 color graphics mode that allows multiple
pages.  I want something like mode 0x10 (640x350x16 2 pages).  I have been
experimenting with graphics by calling the BIOS with borland turbo c.  I
feel like I am flying blind in this area, and could use all the help that
you can give.

  Thanks,

can be used for graphics, although I believe Local Buses can be used

                 Series Editor        Volume Editor



Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing
Corporation is planning a special volume on ""Shape Analysis"", scheduled
for this year.

This volume will be a part of ""Progress in Neural Networks,"" an annual
book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and
application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to
present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on
this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.

Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling,
shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching,
surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing
neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated
non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably,
but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. Please send
electronically (if you prefer, you can send a hardcopy to the address below)
an  abstract and an outline to
msuk@ima.enst.fr

	.DXF can not be changed over to .IFF format what it can be changed
to is an object format used by one of the 3D programs on the Amiga. The
only tools around are comercial for that conversion.

Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better
job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
programs. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
accurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when it
creates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary.
If I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem
with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially
printing.

Hello
	I have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a
moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. This I appreciated very
much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO 
information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics
programmer. The subjects are

	1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I
know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to
dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books
and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a
way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in
assembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get
any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?

	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what
the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of
the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will
tell me in ""mostly plain"" english how the vesa calls work.

	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,
I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both
gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is
some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of
programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling
you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I
know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where
are you, and why haven't you written a book yet? 

Please help

The 68070 is made by someone other than Motorola (Signetics perhaps),

It is for a business and the end product has to be a photograph.
I take damaged black and whites, usually old, some very, and repair them
by hand at present.  I would like to do this by using a computer.
I am just trying to find a vendor who can convert my computer stored
images to negatives or thermal print.  The customer will want his/her
copy as much as possible like a brand new original photgraph.

algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.

    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up
all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For
example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up
and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower
bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you
get some illumination equation like this:

        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent

    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light
intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less
hand-waving illumination equation is this:

        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt

    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the
material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from
transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a
purple-colored glass object.

    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my ""illumination
equation sermon"" to you also.

I also would like code or algorithms to do this.

In fact, I am interested in sources for code and/or algorithms that
convert 2D graphical objects into other 2D graphical objects that
will render into the same image. i.e. Bezier curves to B splines,
or splines to circular arc segments, or B splines to polgons, etc...

Subject: Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ
Lines: 130


----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------

-- WHAT IS LightWave? --

LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the ""Toaster"" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an
Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and
LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.

-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as
a group.

-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --

Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!

-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --

To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining.  Expect a ""welcome"" message within 5 days after you
send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!

-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --

Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the
following address:

        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the
opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain

I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the
list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI
hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>

I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please
send a mail message to:

        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com

The first command to the server must be ""HELP"" or ""USER name <passwd>"".

Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.
Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.
Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.



-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --

Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have
something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to
the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>

If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact
me at the address:

        lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com

Cheers,

    Yes.  There are many methods of rendering, raytracing is one of them.
You didn't say what you mean by rendering, so I won't guess.  Methods of
rendering include:

        o  Pencil and graph paper, doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the 2D projection

        o  Hidden line rendering

        o  Scanline rendering using:
            - Painter's algorithm.
            - BSP trees.
            - Z buffer
            - Other

        o  Raytracing

        o  Radiosity

        o  Holographic projection to film

        o  Combination of any of the above

Hi all,
	I am working on a project in which I need to brake an image
into sub-bands and then work with them.  Since I have never done
anything like this, don't even understand the concept of sub-bands, I
was wondering if there is some software out there that would allow me

Hei Pei.

I can not help you directly width you problem, but there may be
intermediate roads to take to get to the IFF. I am using a converter
that can take IGES, IIF, DXF -> IGES, MILESPEC I IGES, MILESPEC II IGES, 
IIF, MILESPEC I IIF, MILESPEC II IIF  and DXF.

IIF is IBM IGES FORMAT. There may be converters out there that can handle
IGES to IFF. Hope this was to any help. By the way the converter is part
of the IGES Processor/6000 package from IBM and it runs on RS/6000 AIX.

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file
that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands
for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually
named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most
GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes
of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some
copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there
a long time ago).

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline
algorithm, but not tremendously faster.  I spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about 10% faster.  This is
all C (on HP PA-RISC the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as
fast as possible, as far as I could tell).  For any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time, and can be made all convex.  Definitely the
way to go.

Keywords: 3-D widget, manipulation, feedback, user interface design system

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would
like to have in your applications.  

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the 
application.  It may let you

- manipulate application data, the camera,
  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or
- view the status of the application or 3-D objects
  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or
- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.

For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a
partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.
A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length
of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and
feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between
the objects along its own axis.


Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information
I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.
Your help is very much appreciated.

I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF (JFIF) file

to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
whole image.

How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF?

How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
picture?

I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the
filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing
the header chunks. The output looks like this:

  157605  bla.gif                                  640x 480  248C24

I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a
similar tool for JFIF, with an output like this:

   57605  bla.jpg                                  640x 480     C24

I think the main reason is that in the good old hacker days of the young(er)
Gates' and Jobs' of the world, the computer was not as widespread a
phenomenom as it is now.  With the increased popularity of the PC
come a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical
minded and narrower-focused programmers.

Why be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or
programs for accountants?  Basically, the yuppies caught up and
disciplined the hackers, and molded them in their own image.

           Cornell Theory Center Summer School
 
          Offered through the Cornell School of
        Continuing Education and Summer Sessions
 
                  Course Description
 
 Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of
Lines: 197

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video
recording equipment.
 
Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization.
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           first-come first-served basis.
 
Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken
           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,
           X-windows and C is useful but not required.
 
Date:   June 14-25, 1993  (2 Credits)
        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)
 
Time:   Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm
 
Cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
        2 credits           $820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing
    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics
workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the
E&S Freedom.


Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.

------

Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics
subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use
a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both
have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of
pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly
in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have 
similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market
penetration.

There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and
E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end
developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and
flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to
sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at
a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom
systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that
support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom
design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing
developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose
applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and
video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note
that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not
require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,
however, will remain much more flexible.

The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.
Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end
Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price
points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because
it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting
in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide
strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that
not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's
configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase
geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade
them separately as needed.

Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at
workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive
VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide
this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation
of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher
qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali
provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.
Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism
for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics
data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation
modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels
to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking
texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable
solution.

Hope this helps,

Brian

I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to

""A note on gamma correction and images""

Author: Graeme W. Gill
        graeme@labtam.oz.au

Date: 93/5/16


""What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?""
--------------------------------------

Although it would be nice to think that ""an image is an image"",
there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded
images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image
viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some
look too light. ""Why is this ?"" you may ask. This, is gamma correction
(or the lack of it).

Why do we need gamma correction at all ?
--------------------------------------

Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode
ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene, then you have created a ""linear"" or un-gamma-corrected
image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).
Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this:

Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma

So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image
will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to ""gamma correct""
the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT
will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get
what you want. So you have to do this to your image:

gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)

For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.

If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?
-----------------------------------------------------

The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.
Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras
or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are 
rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those
images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will
look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular CRT.

Whose fault is all this ?
-----------------------

It is really three things. One is all those display programs
out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is
that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or
don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.
The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying
gamma's.

At least two file formats do the right thing.
The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording
the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a
linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).

Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and
utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.

[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the
appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity
in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends
to give a tint to the image. ]

How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg
(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using
dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a
bit.)

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center.

If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be
around 2.2 

[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the
-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA
environment variable in your .profile]

How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?
-------------------------------------------------

This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of
1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma
correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images
(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected
to some degree or other.

If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will
look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.

Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as
Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium. This is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic. This means images 
could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),
if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level.

If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).

   I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
   will do compositing of a series of pictures?

   What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip
   (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
   bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
   pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
   the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
   with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
   manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
   a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to
   composite a series of frames would be even better.

   I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform
   this.  Help, please!

If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation
into AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will do
this for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color
""clear"", and overlay it over another animation.  I do not have a way
right now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files.  Animator
will also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so if
your video capture stuff can create this is might work.

G'Day All,

I'm looking for a program to convert BMP images to GIF, TGA or even PPM.

I'd prefer a unix program, but Dos is fine also.

I've seen Alchemy (for DOS) and some windows image viewers which can save
an image in other formats, but what I'm after is a converter not a viewer...

Any help would be apprieciated!

cheers
Stephen.

I need a graphics display program that can take as a parameter the name of

All of the other graphics display programs come up with a menu first or some

This program is going to be run from within another program.  I have lots of

Go with CorelDraw.  PCMag just did a review a couple of issues ago and Adobe

As far as I know it's okay.  You'd have to read the licence agreement that
comes with the package to be sure.

An automatic mail handler at Brown University allows users of ""Computer
Graphics: Principles and Practice,"" by Foley, van Dam, Feiner, and
Hughes, to obtain text errata and information on distribution of the
software packages described in the book.  Also, users can send the
authors feedback, to report text errors and software bugs, make
suggestions, and submit exercises.  To receive information describing
how you can use the mail handler, simply mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu
and put the word ""Help"" in the Subject line.  Use the Subject line
""Software-Distribution"" to receive information specifically concerning
the software packages SRGP and SPHIGS.

Errata for ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"" is available on
wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books/IntroToRT.errata.

Errata for ""Digital Image Warping"" is in the same directory as
""Digital-Image-Warping.errata"".

All C code from the ""Graphics Gems"" series is available via anonymous ftp
from princeton.edu.  Look in the directory pub/Graphics/GraphicsGems for
the various volumes (Gems, GemsII, GemsIII), and get the README file first.

Errata to _Graphics Gems_ and _Graphics Gems II is available on
wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books.

A list of computer graphics, computational geometry and image processing
journals is available from Juhana Kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi.


2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen.

The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose
explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:

The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes ""Computer Graphics"" book is certainly
a good start.  Chapter 6 is ""Viewing in 3D"", then read chapter 15,
""Visible-Surface Determination"".  For more information go to chapter 16 for
shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.


3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.

Find a copy of ""Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display"" by
Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other
algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations
are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).

A variant method is described in ""Graphics Gems"", p. 287-293.  Note that
the code from the ""Graphics Gems"" series is all available from an FTP site,
as described above.

Check out John Bradley's ""Diversity Algorithm"", which is incorporated into
the xv package and described in the back of the manual.

The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another
quantizing algorithm which is presented as ""doing a better job than the
other algorithms, but slower"".

There's also an implementation of:

Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data
Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),
pp. 153-162.

avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,
in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.


4) Converting color into grayscale.

The NTSC formula is:

    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue


5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.

The only reference you need for this stuff is:

    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6

But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation
software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do
some form of gray to b&w conversion.


6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.

The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.
This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,
loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*
transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.
This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one
2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing
sub-pixel sampling.

However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,
which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally
created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is
also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: ""A Fast Algorithm for Raster
Rotation"", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics
Interface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in
the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears
in ""Graphics Gems"" (see section [1]) under the original title.


7) Free image manipulation software.

There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to
another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus
the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.
Here are pointers to some of them:

    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format
    conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing
    of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file
    contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

    PBMPLUS, by Jef Poskanzer.  Comprehensive format conversion and image
    manipulation package.  The latest version is always available via
    anonymous FTP as ftp.ee.lbl.gov:pbmplus*.tar.Z,
    wuarchive.wustl.edu:graphics/graphics/packages/pbmplus/pbmplus*.tar.Z,
    and export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/pbmplus*.tar.Z.

    IM Raster Toolkit, by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca).
    Provides a portable and efficient format and related toolkit.  The
    format is versatile in supporting pixels of arbitrary channels,
    components, and bit precisions while allowing compression and machine
    byte-order independence.  The kit contains more than 50 tools with
    extensive support of image manipulation, digital halftoning and format
    conversion.  Previously distributed on tape c/o the University of
    Waterloo, an FTP version will appear someday.

    Utah RLE Toolkit.  Conversion and manipulation package, similar to
    PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,

    ftp.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.

    Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>.  Reads and
    writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some
    image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP as
    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, and
    venera.isi.edu:pub/img_1.3.tar.Z along with a large collection of color
    images.

    Xim, X Image Manipulator, by Philip R. Thompson.  It does essential
    interactive image manipulations and uses x11r4 and the OSF/Motif toolkit
    for the interface.  It supports images in 1, 8, 24 and 32 bit formats.
    Reads/writes and converts to/from GIF, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, and
    other formats.  Writes level 2 postscript.  Other utilities and image
    application library are included.  Not a paint package.  Available via
    ftp from gis.mit.edu.

    xloadimage, by Jim Frost <madd@std.com>.  Reads in images in various
    formats and displays them on an X11 screen.  Available via FTP as
    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xloadimage*, and in your nearest comp.sources.x
    archive.

    xli, by Grame Gill, is an updated xloadimage with numerous improvements
    in both speed and in the number of formats supported.  Available in the

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could someone
mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers that will
send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for
details on some.

Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion
of software like this.  You may find useful information there.


8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.

You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on free
image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and
look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you
were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the
format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.

These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.
This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object
formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark
Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.

A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained
by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,
neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most
often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images
but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and
information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.



9) Converting between vector formats.

A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw
to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very
different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting
one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you
get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects
are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.
The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled
round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.
Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do
a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.

There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The
contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.
A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.

On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,
rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.
As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such
converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been
posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive
site.

A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to
X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for
PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,
the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can
be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the
answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to
vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be
trivial.

GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes
drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as
a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements
essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript
and level 2).


10) How to get Pixar films.

The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available
on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:

    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price
    Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00
    Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00
    Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00
    Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00
    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00

All tapes are on 1/2"" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also
available:

    Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00
    Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)

For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for
each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H
for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add
$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,
213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify
prices and availability.  Or, just write to:

    Direct Cinema Limited
    1749 14th Street
    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342

Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:

At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts
for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly
more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's
available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).

    Pixar
    1001 West Cutting Blvd.
    Richmond, CA. 94804
    (510) 236-4000 
    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)

You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains ""Luxo, Jr."", ""Red's
Dream"", ""Tin Toy"" and ""Knicknack"" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They
will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I 
ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect 
to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license
agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.


11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?

The short answer is, ""You can't.""  Unless you use a rational spline you
can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,
but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of
approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not
visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to
do the job right, consult the article:

  ""A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles""
  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller
  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,
  September, 1989, pages 48-56.

For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:

  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture
  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,
  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.

For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:

  ""Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves""
  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken
  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),
  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]


12) How to order standards documents.

The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also
ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,
mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the
complete name and number.

Some useful numbers to know:

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical
Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical
Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI
Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;
for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.

Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit
comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let
you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering
at 1-800-854-7179.


13) How to FTP by email.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying ""help"" and it will tell you how to use
it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.


14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.

Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,
the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of
edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior
hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in
the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in
Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including
treatment of special cases.

Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all
the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,
if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an
order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the
trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.

Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in
the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:
pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.


15) How to tessellate a sphere.

One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The
base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides
each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>
has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.
It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.

16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.

Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:

Highlights of this edition-

    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through
       November '91;
    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG
        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;
    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;
    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;
    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.

The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.
Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named
""speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z"" and is compressed at most sites-

             Site                             Dir
	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/

	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/
	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics
	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/

Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global
illumination bibliographies.  These are in ""refer"" format, and so can be
searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is
included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the
sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at
princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as ""RayBib.*"" and ""RadBib.*"".

Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray
tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially
in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This
collection is available at most of the sites above as ""rtabs.*"".

17) SIGGRAPH information online

[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]

ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org
(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both
anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.

The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes
both conference and publications subdirectories.

To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to
     archive-server@siggraph.org
and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send
followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with
the command
     send index
which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.


18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available

[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]

ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings
at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available
in three formats:
     text   (ASCII)
     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)
     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)
They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:

(1) by anonymous ftp
    change to one of the directories
       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]
    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word
    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary 
    mode.

    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the
    contents of each panel file.

(2) by electronic mail
    send mail to
       archive-server@siggraph.org
    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you
    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages
       send panel91-txt index
       send panel91-rtf index
    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary
    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.


19) Graphics mailing lists

There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each
covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an
active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the
focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic
to be nothing short of amazing.

Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you
would like to see added.

20) Specific references on file formats

    Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine, Windcrest/McGraw-Hill
      1992, ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 paper, ISBN 0-8306-3060-0 $36.95 hardcover,
      ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 $24.95 paper.  Comments - 26 formats, no software
      (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).
      Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.


21) What about GIF?

GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon
a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the
keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like
it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question
which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list
of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.

Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info
Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info
Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,
	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,
	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers

Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from
pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:

/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1
/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2

Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail
message containing any or all of:

send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1
send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2

Send a message containing ""help"" to get general information about the
mail server.

Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and
20 above for more information.


22) What is morphing?

Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new
location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.
Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and
morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au
in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:

        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)
        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)
        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)

The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and
uncompress them afterwards.


23) How to ray-trace height fields

Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,
such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they
get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be
located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.

The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:

F. Kenton Musgrave
Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields
July, 1988
<musg88.ps.Z>

This is available as ""Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639"" from Yale University,
it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and
Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:

    nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z
    weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z
    princeton.edu		pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z
    coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z
    gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU	pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z

An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.

24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon

	The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation),

     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -
	            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );

and the area of a planar polygon is given by

     area = 0.0;

     for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )
         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );
     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );
     area /= 2.0;

If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is
clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.

>From Ronald Golman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above), ""Area
 of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:""

The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is
given by

     Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |

where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal
vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x
represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation
operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal
to P0.


25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH

Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your
local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.
Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.
Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,
Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)

SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for
Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions
on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or
Associate Members.

If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you
$59.00 (no student discount).

There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.

ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. 
Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318.

	Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than
you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed
HDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,
even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm
guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).

	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.

	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier
to deal with.

Very good point.  Is there someone out there that is working on this?
I'd offer my time to help manage/do it all myself but yaw'll are not
going to hear from me over the summer.  I'm not trying to be pushy,
and there is being progress made (re: pov mailing list).

Plus, *many* sites, (especially many .com sites) do not carry any alt
newsgroups. (We don't for example.) A comp.* group will get a much broader
distribution and would be useful to many more people. Plus the topic is
important/popular enough to warrant its own group, IMHO.

 I have a copy of 'The Earth-From Space' on my wall that I purchased
from Space Shots, Inc. (LA, CA  (800) 272-2779).  As printed on the
poster, the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project.
The image IS copyrighted, so I doubt that you'll find it legally in
the public domain.  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
GeoSphere Project (an environmental education thing), and the cost is
nominal, so crack a 20 and buy one!  Also, I don't think it's always
safe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project, any
products will be provided for free.  Many government agencies (NASA, NOAA)
and some private groups (National Geographic) provided assistance to the
GeoSphere Project.  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
educating the public, rather than pure research.

How can I find these files and graphics that people

do I download them? I am a complete beginner in
this (obviously), so please baby-step me through
the process. First of all, I don't see amongst
these newsgroups where there is anything remotely
like a GIF, TIF, or compiled shareware program?

Thanks in advance for any information you can
give me. (I know there is a Unix command, ""ftp,""

need to know where to go to find the file

Try ImageMagick. I cannot test it but one told me it does 24bit.
Anyway, are you SURE your Xserver supports 24bit TrueColor visuals ?

Subject: Tangent vectors of Kochanek-Bartels splines
Organization: University of Trondheim
Lines: 33

I'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame
positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm
using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84
proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between
the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form
(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and
z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
positioned at (x,y,z).

The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the
positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've
tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are
not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although
the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain
- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation
error...)

Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.
I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at
  iharkest@lise.unit.no
Anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of
the replies if they contact me.

Hi!

We have an old Montage FR-1 35mm film recorder. When connected to a PC with
its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language
files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from 
whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language
seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language
that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps
something else ?

The question is, where can I find some information about this language ?
A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ?

(OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I'm not THAT
optimistic...)

Thanks in advance for any help!

""Only""?!?  That's a long time! (echoing above posting)  The way the market
is going nowadays, your machine's obsolete two weeks before you buy it. 
Sounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but
that's sometimes necessary for equipment.

: Is that a reasonable life

I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.  If
you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot
point, perhaps.

You can. At the least, your _hardware_ is capable of supporting this mode.
I do know nothing about your video BIOS, though...

Hello there!

A week ago a guy asked what a .SCO file was - well I researched a bit and foundout that it is just another RIX file. .SCI files are 320x200 files and .SCO files are 1024x768 files! alle the other formats (800x600, 640x480...) are also called something like .SC(character).

A word of warning for those of you registering for SIGGRAPH '93.
I just received my registration form back in the mail with the
envelope marked ""Return to sender. Moved - Left No Address.
Closed PO Box"". The address I used to register for SIGGRAPH '93
is the one printed on the registration form:

     ACM SIGGRAPH '93

I printed the envelope in my best printing, honest but evidently

Hello,

Thanks to the people who helped me with the problem of

Hello,
I have some problem in converting tga file(generated by POVray) to

if I use xloadimage/getx11, something is wrong.

Error messages are,
% targatorle -o o.rle data.tga

o.rle is a 0x0 24 bit RLE image with no map (will dither to 8 bits), with gamma of 1.00

xloadimage: X Error: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) on 0x0

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm, but I do not spend
time to install them. Even I do not want to generate .rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle, if possible.(.rgb to rle works, but
it will mess up my directory with so many files, and it needs 2 more
steps to finally convert to rle file. say cat | rawtorle | rleflip )
Does any body out there have same experience/problems ?

                FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE

          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24
          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-
          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-
          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-
          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was
          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS
          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-
          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and
          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS
          users  to  ""take  charge of your PHIGS"" by participating in PHIGS
          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS
          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,
          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  ""beyond
          PHIGS"".

          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following
          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,
          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented
          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS
          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and
          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The
          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-
          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools
          based on PHIGS.

          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.

          PHIGS EVERYWHERE

          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated
          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to
          mainframes.

          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including
          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing
          and translucency.

          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-
          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add
          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like
          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.
          Radiosity support is also planned.

          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging
          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate
          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase
          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.

          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful
          ""2-call""  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-
          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.

          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on
          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-
          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-
          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS
          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS
          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data
          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS
          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described
          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions
          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-
          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available
          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or
          Starbase.

          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows
          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most
          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many
          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-
          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS
          or ARENA is available on request.

          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-
          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most
          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-
          porates PEX support.

          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital
          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the
          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.
          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with
          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most
          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as
          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and
          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

          poration.  GRAFPAK-PHIGS and ATC are trademarks of Advanced Tech-
          nology Center. PEX and X11 are trademarks of Massachusetts Insti-
          tute of Technology.

          The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340
          workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.

          Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A
          Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics
          PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance-
          ments.

          The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS
          applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and
          PHIGS standards bodies.  For more  information  about  the  PHIGS

                                  OTG

I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the
promotion of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method,
procedures,algorythms, applications, implementation, extensions of
NAPLPS/JPEG standards.  These standards should facilitate the creation
of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice, Video,
Telecommuting, HiRes graphics, Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online
order entry, Fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to
better understand how SGML, CALS, ODA, MIME, OODBMS, JPEG, MPEG,
FRACTALS, SQL, CDrom, cdromXA, Kodak PhotoCD, TCL, V.FAST, and
EIA/TIA562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications.

We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2
platforms.  It is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations,
Universities, R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.

This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already
many corporations have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so
do not delay joining if you are a developer

An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon
be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject.  If
you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
address below.

This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG
newsletter as well as a hardcopy version.  We urge all who wants to
see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W, decide to
join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.

NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone
      lines/LAN.

Subject: Tel.# for 3D scanners needed!
Organization: University of Vienna

NNTP-Posting-Host: helios.edvz.univie.ac.at

Hello all,
   I need to make  some torso 3D scans and would like the phone numbers of
companies in the midwest that make scans, and the numbers of companies that
make the sanners (ie Cyberware). Does anyone have an idea of how much a
single scan costs and the best format to save it in? I am not sure on what
software platform I will be using it in, probably either Softimage or
Wavefront. So I think a spline based format would be best. Please forward the
numbers to me personally as I am having problems accessing USENET lately.
Thanks in advance!

Get the generic version (for Unix and VMS) and build it. IMHO a
VMS .com file to build it is supplied.
As the distribution comes as .tar.Z you should either have uncompress
and tar on VMS or a UNIX flavoured machine handy.
Usually you won't find this on IBM-PC specific archives, but on the better
ones :)

Lets see if I have this right... HSV == HSB == HSL ... and none of those

not yet another color model... 

The following code should do the HSV (HSL) coding (I haven't tried it yet)

===================================================
Last Change : 27 April 1993


14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)

  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner
  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).
  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.

Robot
-----
  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written
  in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).

Athena Plotter Widget set
-------------------------
  
  This version V6.0 is based on Gregory Bond's version V5-beta. Added
  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,
  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.
  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the
  plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a
  log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other
  changes/extensions, besides 
  
  -     Origin and frame lines for axes.

PLPLOT
------
  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)
  and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness,
  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:
  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,
  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or
  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually
  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are
  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four
  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and
  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.
  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),
  including a portable metafile format and renderer.
  
  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on
  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.


Macintosh-based tools
=====================

NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more
---------------------------------
  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,
  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been
  developed by Spyglass.

  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

Dimple
------
  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or
  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has
  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image
  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose.""

  ""Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its
  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of
  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt
  language for writing ""programs"" for processing an image, defining
  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down
  menus etc... It is unprotected software.""

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

  starter program except for the obtuse manual""

IMAGINE-32
----------
  It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called ""Imagine32""
  or ""Image32"" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,
  subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.
  It can also display a number of images simultaneously.
  The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA.

AIPS
----
  Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,
  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,
  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)
  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building
  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.
     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy
  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a
  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few. 

LABOimage

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The
  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
  processing of remote sensed data.

Global Imaging Software
-----------------------
  ""We use Global Imaging Software to process AVHRR data, from the dish to
  the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to
  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
  and carefree.

  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.

  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for
  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000
  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display""

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA
----
[ Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal. These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in
  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.
o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for
   registration.
o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or
   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers
   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,
   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and
   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights
   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass
   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)
   to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system.
o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to
   HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.)
o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image
Processing. I am looking for any material related to the field, and am
also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
field. In particular source code for general use packages.

I already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more
input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not
mathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so
any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not
mathematically intensive.

The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:

""Practical Digital Image Processing""
by Rhys Lewis
ISBN: 0-13-683525-2
Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.

Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.
'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code
to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement
via convolution etc.

If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am
most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer
source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing
code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of
demonstration it would be most helpful.

All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,
and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.

Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 
So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 
So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood
etc.
Now you are saying:

>We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,

If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
discussion a *lot* easier.

Eh? Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is
not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this
paragraph defeats me.

Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.

But this statement contradicts what you said earlier:

No I don't think so actually. 

You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),
manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these
changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual
colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?

Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!

I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.

What are you saying
???

Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are
saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem!!

Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.

Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an
approach clumsy, however.

Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one
through.

>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
>designed for that.

As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what
the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.

>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; 

Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,
having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the 8 bit image palette.

Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?

>say,
>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
>expected that the image still is the same. 

Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.

>So, XV were designed
>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
>program work -- design error.

Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)

Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets
you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the
human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
was designed for. It makes no false claims.

>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
>major change to the original design.

If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So 
far, you have not done so.

>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it
if it is so easy.

Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.

I think this is a bit of an exageration.

What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in
the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else
had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...

>Well, my text may be a bit hard reading,

Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly
thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. Go think
some more.

How about the GNU people, handing out very good, free software?  I've also
distributed two decent-sized programs myself, the Go player Fumiko (at
ftp.u.washington.edu) and the Genetic Neural Network Programmer CEREBRUM
(somewhere out there).

I've only had time to write these programs because of scholarships and
grants.  The intended benefit to society, or a loophole in the system?

Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much
as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is
when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need
a mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose
graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture
rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the
mapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply
textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally
unsuitable for my needs.

Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a
PC?  I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this
must be saved in a file which I can read.  I haven't found any info on Alias
in the copy of the faq that I have.

Subject: Please Help: Point in concave Polyhedra
Lines: 43

Dear Netters:


I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a

concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this.

    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. ""Ray-casting and block model conversion
using a spatial index"". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).
But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?
I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case.


   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal. It says ""if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra..."". Again how to make
sure ?


   Any pointers are welcome ?

Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.

Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)
frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous
frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.

>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)

Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+
card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24
bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.

I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller
size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays
introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated
by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I
would like to automate the procedure.

The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the
obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to
XV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images
are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image
colors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the
public domain? If so, where?

|And no, SIGGRAPH 93 has not skipped town -- we're preparing the best
|SIGGRAPH conference yet!

Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration
for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever
grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!

For example:

	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same
	thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the
	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,
	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the
	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.

	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.

	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI
	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,
	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic
	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.

	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the
	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to
	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG
	also has doubled its membership fee.

What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it
sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple,
like SIGGRAPH, all the ""plus"" services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%
increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%
inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am?

OK, never heard of Cross filters, but Roberts, Prewitt and Sobel filters
are standard spatial masks for edge detection.  Highpass filtering does a
good job of detecting edges, too.  A good reference for all sorts of general
digital image processing is the book _Digital Image Processing_ by

I've used this source to do the above filters and many other things as a

                      Genoa Presents High Performance 
                        Video Graphics Accelerator

        SAN JOSE, Calif USA -- Genoa Systems Corporation announces 
WINDOWSVGA 24,  a True Color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that 
delivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the 
competition.  Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high 
refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  
The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local 
bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).
        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers 
maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate 
of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 
non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater 
than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video 
standards.
        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, 
which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more 
comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility 
developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen 
and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.
        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed 
offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards 
will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will 
transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is 
also offering this card in the ""TurboBahn"" combination packaged 
with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.
        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, 
WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance 
value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to ""turbocharge"" 
the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with 
power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced 
chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and 
reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D 
Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins 
are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.
        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of 
graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for 
IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two 
year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are 
currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, 
resellers, VARs and systems integrators.
        For more information contact Joe Brunoli, Marketing 
Manager, Genoa Systems at 75 E. Trimble Road, San Jose, Calif.

Keywords: coda finale music font atm petrucci eps adobe

I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript 
laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been 
fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do 
some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might 
not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 
2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. 

The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a 
rather important font :-) 

I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the 
[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't 
work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files 
generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I 
manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file 
everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs 
to work with. 

And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are 
listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. 
Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows 
applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. 

Has anyone encountered problems like this? 

What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1

Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?

I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats

Note that the two tables don't talk about the same population.  One is
Fortune 1000 companies favoring the platform as their primary
application platform, the other is sales (to everyone, not just
Fortune 1000).  Fortune 1000 companies don't do a lot of development
with the Mac as their top platform.  I would expect that that would
explain the discrepancy.

I've been using Windows NT (tm) since the October release, and I have to 
say that the March release is really a big improvement.  Windows NT (tm)
is becomming usable.

There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.
First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.
What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other
resourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  
And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone
knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), 
please let me know.

The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.
For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster
(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't 
produced drivers yet.

Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and
give the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever
you wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into
Windows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.

Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows
though.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should
really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work
well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never
heard of anyone else who did either.

It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the
box, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity.

I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint
of heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta.

Subject: WordBasic - Visual Basic - Macros/Template ???

I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows.
Specifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports.
Since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is:

1.  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit?

As I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get
around the above problem, I am working on the following approach:

I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the
WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load
this template of mine, which will work in the following way:

It will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the
.INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file.

1.  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way
to specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file?

2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to
read more than the 32k at one time?

Any help will be appreciated.

The format for Word for Windows doc files is available from Microsoft.
Call their Developer Support Services number (sorry, don't have it handy)
and ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec.

Warning:  It is not terribly useful, and you will need to do a *lot* of
looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored.

General primer:

Word for Windows stores its data in two chunks.  The first chunk is the
actual text in the file.  This is all stored together and has nothing
but text and graphics.  The second chunk is the formatting information.

For general use, to read a Word for Windows file, skip the first 384 bytes
of the file (its a general header).  Then read the remaining text until you
hit binary data.

I have the following problem on a Dell 450SE with the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 
EISA:

When I start Windows, the first 5 times I try to run an application, it does
not start. Windows will show the following error message:

   Error Executing application. There is not enough memory to run the    
   application.

After the first 5 tries, the application I want to run will start, and 
afterwards there are no more problems. When I change the Video driver from 
Mach 32 to 8514/a, this problem does not occur, so I suspect the ATI 
drivers (I tried both the build 55 and build 59 driver).

Does anyone have a clue?

News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41


    This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help.

    I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.

    When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many
    of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT
    2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when
    I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under
    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than
    my shell running.

    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some
    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  

    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are
    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at
    plugging this leak?

    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?

    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with
    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.

    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was
    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different
    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)

    5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less
    likely my code will eat resources?

    6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for
    specifically?

    Thanks for your help.  As this is a common problem and I have seen only
    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
    me email.

Well, this is *only* a guess:  If it goes by the ""true"" meaning of ""bit

Good question.
Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?)
        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus.
        I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.
        The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but
        they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.
        So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at
        33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.
        So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on
        a 33 mhz cpu.  EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as
        fast as ISA.

That's a very good question.  The EISA bus does have more advantages
over the ISA bus than just it's width.  For example: more/better 
interrupts and bus mastering.  But these other factors do not impact
 a video card very much.  They have more impact on file servers with 
multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.

Speaking of that.....
My comp has ""emmexclude=$e000-$efff"" or something of that nature in the
system.ini file.  Or some system file for *windows*.

I was just wondering if having that line in a *windows* startup file is
better, as it will give some more memory on dos apps., but disable it
when you run windows?

(Actually, I *do* think that that line is also in the system.1 file)

Subject: Problem on DOS box from Windows - ""this file is compressed...""
Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 16

I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute
a DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the File
Manager. A message box comes up and says ""This program or one of its
components is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the
file.""

Now, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the program
from DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM
(yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tells
me that the file is already expanded.

All my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when trying
to execute a DOS program from Windows.

Clues anyone?  Thanks!!   Christopher Wroten, cfw@world.std.com

Hello,

recently I noticed there is a directory named ""DiskImage"" in my disk.  I didn't
notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files.
I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of
the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

Thanks,

Anibal

Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane!

I have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears
to be memory-related.  It's actually not limited to windows, but
that's where it causes most of my problems.  Ths machine's 486DX33,
8Meg RAM, 256Kcache, TRIDENT TVGA card, PAS-16 soundcard.

1)  Windows runs REALLY, REALLY slow most of the time.  Slower than
on my old 386SX16.  Graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow,
applications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear.
(Note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things that
appear to be related.  Several run slow, my .mod player crashes the
system etc..)

2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other
programs)  COMPLETELY fixes the problem.  Windows will run as fast as
I've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than
when I don't run BC beforehand.

3)  I don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys.  Installing
emm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse.  After emm386 is
installed, running BC will not fix the problem anymore.

This problem is driving me nuts.  If you think you can help,
please reply through the mail.

Evan

For bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending

Why is Win 3.1 sometimes so finicky?
I have a new DELL 486DX2/66mhz  8 megs RAM.
Windows was working just great.  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem.
DELL replaced the mouse, gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard.  Just prior to this problem windows would
]only load up every other time.  I would get the LOGO and either it would
go on into windows or LOCK UP.  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME.

Now with the new motherboard and all, it still does the same thing.
The computer is less than one month old.  At first it worked FINE!
I can get into windows each time now with the   win/s command.
This forces Standard mode.  Things seem to run slower.  I mainly
use windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem.....
plus it is slower.

I re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing.  Should I first delete
everything in all windows dir's?  I did not because I have so much 
added in sub dir's etc.

Really puzzling why ENHANCED MODE would not load each time but consistently
every other time.  Standard mode each time......

ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ???

does accept font and page orientation changes, so I don't

I reloaded QuattroPro, and these changes are still not

Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how to

You're right.

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 3.5"" disk or Apple II
5.25"" disk without extra hardware. However, Mac 1.44MB disks can be read
and written in a PC 3.5"" HD drive with software only.

I think you would need a DOS macro program.  Superkey (by Borland?)
comes to mind.  I don't think Windows is capable of sending
keystrokes to a DOS window.

Does this need to have anything to do with disk compression? I have 
experienced the same thing a couple of times myself, but *without* any disk 
compression stuff installed. (For example, guess what happened when Norton 
SpeedDisk once crashed during defragmenting!)

One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from
other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. From then on other
workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf 
again. 

The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machine

It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver, rather

Well, I got  WINZIP from cica (don't know which version, but I think
it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and I was initially imressed.
But here's the low-down:

WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you
vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a
/checkout directory, and creates a ""checkout"" .grp and group if you want
to check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on
exit, if you didn;t like the program.

*HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't
konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I
""zip"" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something
or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit
all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know
(as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do,
now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the ""run"" cmd)
but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip
file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.
I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.

Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful ""unzip""ing
functions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new
ver.  (as for now, a good old, ""run-->unzip *.zip"" will work.

(PS> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).

	I don't think the question is:

	A more important question is:
		""will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps
		from subsequent Windows versions in the future?""

	Can it keep up?  Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps?
	OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.
	After this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to

	some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  Would

  If you want longer filenames for your documents, I heard of a wordprocessor for
windows which let you assign long names to files. Those long filenames could only be
seen from that programs open/save dialogs though... Maybe someone knows more about

On my PC I almost exclusively run windows. The only dos based application  
I have is ProcommPlus.  In my config.sys I have emm386 loaded with the  
option noems (no expanded memory). Following a thread in one of the comp  
newsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded. Indeed,  
in the manual, it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of  
extended memory. Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the  
emm386 device is useless in my case. 

Should I use emm386 or should I remove it from my config.sys?

Thanks for your help,

	Path of least resistance (TM) :) :
Get WinGIF 1.4 from cica (ftp.cica.indiana.edu pub/pc/win3/(desktop?) )
It will save to native .rle format unlike PSP (an otherwise fine, fine prog)
Make a file using anything that has to be less than 30k, as Michael said,
and less than 16 colors... Import it to WinGIF as gif, pcx or bmp and
save it in you windows/system subdir as vgalogo.rle (NOT .lgo). Exit Win,
and run setup in the windows subdir. Reselect your _current_ config. Run
Win. Voila'
(minor correction: the .rle file has to be <30k. that means ~15k gif ?)
Hope it helps... (and please, please someone put this in the group's FAQ)

You have one. Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will
print it. You need to associate file extensions with such things as the
notepad for it to do this though.

After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos

of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a
head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have, 
however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY
do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but
OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard
that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew
where to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like, 
once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

If you happen to be running the new msdos 6, you could use multi-

the machine ... power up, select your name,  the menu will use your

EMM386 is NOT reqired to load the DOS kernal high (or else you couldn't
do it on a 286).  In a mail message I recommended that he remove it
since he only runs ProcomPlus frequently in DOS, and I suspect
EMM386 will slow down windows.

Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better.

1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.
   That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You
   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left
   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your ""left
   and right window"" as you can have as many open as you wish instead 
   of just two.

2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking
   on the executable's icon.

3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double
   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have
   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The
   ""browse"" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you
   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.
   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your
   requirement for ""text reading and graphics viewing"".

I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up
all the associations you need is the way to do it.

If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be
pretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how
some things are done.

Hi,

	I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988

It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause
the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386

trying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.

The sensitivity is changed using the /S, /V, or /H parameter.  
The commands do the following:
/V - vertical sensitivity
/H - horizontal sensitivity
/S - both 

Follow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 (1 - slowest, 100-fastest).
The default is 50.  You can type the command ""mouse /S75"" right from the
keyboard or add it to autoexec.bat.

: In other words, it is your *opinion* that MSW3.1 is inferior to its
: competition.  That's not the same as MSW3.1 being objectively inferior.

No.  It is technically inferior to the OS/GUIs that I listed.  I have already
described why.  To say briefly:

System 7 --easier to learn and use.  There have been independent studies to 
           that effect.
OS/2     --Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking.
NeXTSTep --easier to learn, use, and program. More stable multitasking
UNIX/X   --As easy to learn and use.  More stable multitasking.

With the prpoer setup, all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as
well as MSW machines will amongst themselves, so interoperability is not
an issue.

By this criterion, it is inferior.  If you have another, then perhaps I am
incorrect.  Do you pick up the glove?

Does anyone have any information or better, first-hand experience,
of the new Epson bubblejet printer - Stylus 800??

I'm particularly interested in hearing how well it works under Windows;
I presume that a special printer driver is required - is it supplied
as standard? Is it able to print everything that a standard Postscript
laserprinter could??

Here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server.  
The WinHelp() function, as I am told by MS, does search your path so 
relocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include
the path to where you move them to, however, if an application has 
hardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it
searches the given path (i.e. WinHelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for example) then
WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory
where you have installed your software.

I tested this out on a variety of software packages.  I moved all my 
helpfiles to the drive z:\ and included this in the path statement.
Here is the results for different software packages:


Norton Desktop			Found Helpfiles
Windows V3.1 for WorkGroups	Found Helpfiles
Windows V3.1			Found Helpfiles
MS Powerpoint V3.0		Found Helpfiles
MS Word				Found Helpfiles
MS Excel V4.0a			Did Not Find Helpfiles (strange)
MS Foxpro V2.5 for Windows	Found Helpfiles
Lotus Amipro V3.0		Did Not Find Helpfiles
Procomm Plus for Windows	Did Not Find Helpfiles


I guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to 
specify a global path for helpfiles.  

If anyone has any comments or If I can help anyone or if I left something
out please let me know.

Lets see... what MS products don't have major bugs in them?  Oh, but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up, even if their
customers must buy new ""releases"" from them that are little more than
bug fixes.  Anyone who buys a $2500 computer system and then runs MS
Windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.  

Oh wait! MS innovated the plastic housing on the MS mouse---didn't
they?  ""Logitech Inside""

You can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company
gathers together a bunch of knock-off packages and peddles them to
neophytes.  If MS does anything, it appears someone has to do it
first.  It appears that MS is finding out that throwing money at
technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution.

It could also be that your shell is hogging the resources.  For example,
open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources
with ndw 2.x as shell,
 
then do the same with program manager, and see if it's the shell or the
apps.

Here's an interesting table showing how much resources an application

Application		Min. Resource Use	Resource Not Returned
			GDI	USER		GDI	USER

WinSleuth Gold v3.03	10	6		2	14

*The numbers are in percentage and are in a decreasing order.

What does this table tells you, if you frequently start and exit a
program that doesn't give back all of it's resources, then you
continually lose these resouces.  Therefore, only open these programs
up once and leave them open.

Subject: Question on EISA video board performance
Keywords: EISA, video, performance
Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 25

I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most
EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA
counterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is
only about as ""fast"" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't
what I would call ""fast.""

I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the
same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits.

Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher
cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than
and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a
Diamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report,
I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's
around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow
me to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and still
have $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother-
board too...)

Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?

Thanks!   Christopher Wroten, cfw@world.std.com

Shareware is available from the net, magazines, distributors, clubs,
friends, and bulletin boards. I don't think people have any problems
getting hold of it.

Fill gaps in Dos? There's no need for many people - Dos 5 provides
more services than I need as it is. I just run Windows on top of it.

BTW, my Windows must be an operating system - it provides a Disk
Operating System that Dos can't access. (NFS...) :-)

What version of WinFAX do you have?  The newest version (3.0) has an OCR
(Optical Character Recognition) built in... what this means is that it can
take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit
the document w/o re-typing it... However, I found that the OCR that comes
packaged with WINFAX does not work as well as OMNIpage Professional (also
by Delrina software)... So, once again, WinFAX ver. 3.0 has what you are
looking for... Good luck!

Hi there,

    I plan on upgrading my monitor and video card to 1280x1024. I have
    a DX2/66 ISA (no local bus) system. I would appreciate if anyone can 
    drop me an email of your experience with high-resolution
    video board/monitor. Thanks.

I posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy.  
Well, I think I know why, and it doesn't have anything to do with the 
mouse.  It seems to be the video driver!  Here's why I think that:

A few weeks ago I helped a guy install the driver for his S3 video card for 
windows.  He had been using the normal Windows default VGA driver.  We don't 
have the same kind of mouse (mine is microsoft serial and his is an off-
brand serial mouse).  His mouse worked fine until I installed the S3 (v1.4) 
driver on his system, then his mouse became really jumpy too!

Is there anything I can do?  I need high resolution since I display LOTS of 
stuff on my screen (AMI Pro, Pegasus Mail for Windows, WP Office 4.0 -- 
sorry, nondisclosure!, and alot more).  I noticed there are S3 drivers on 
ftp.cica, but they are the same version that I already have and they are no 
help (I already tried!).

A program called Mac-ette allows you to read Mac 3.5""
high-density disks on a DOS machine. You can get the program from
simtel-20. I'm not sure of the directory location.

Aha, I think I found the problem and it isn't dirt!  Another guy here was 
using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the 
default VGA for Windows).  He has an S3 LocalBus card like I do and when I 
loaded the S3 video driver in Windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.  
Seems like it is the S3 driver!  Is there any newer one than version 1.4 
that would solve this problem?  It is really bad.  I have to use the 
keyboard instead sometimes!  The s3-w31.zip on cica is version 1.4 (which is 
the same version that came with my card).

Please do not do this!

I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I
subscribe to an ""outernet"" system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a
huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for
the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K
modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. 
Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. 
Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I
didn't want in the first place.

If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other
ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like
ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell
people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like
alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives
rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size.

Subject: Print to file: how do I print the file later?
Organization: Mathematics Department, Memorial University of Newfoundland
Lines: 30

Here's the situation:

At home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, I
have windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, I
configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use
the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,
which I then bring to work.

My question:  how do I print this postscript file through the print
manager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file
manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me
several pages of postscript gibberish.

I know that I can open a DOS window and do:

	 copy file.ps com1:

which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications
run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.

There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print
Manager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in the
documentation.

Anyone know how to do this?

Well, you can't say that it don't work.  The inability to read 800k mac
disks is not a SW problem.  Rather, it's a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs. 

I have seen a post about a program able to read non-1.44Mb Mac disks,

just drop into a com port or something.  Don't remember specifics, tho.

I  _do_ know  that  IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in  particular, have
absolutely no  problem  with  OS/2--never had  a ""random"" crash  while
running any of  my programs under  OS/2.   In fact, I  don't  remember
_ever_ crashing.

Of course, I really don't run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch
of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running.

And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running
Dos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a
tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from
particularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the
problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write
buffer, everything would work fine.

FTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies
(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)

Yeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware.  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2...

Well,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that
under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.

I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background.

>> and not being able to address your memory better than DOS,

>	Not sure what you mean here.

The idea is  that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows
DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around
720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see
around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for
my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now
handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course,
the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply
_never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows,
so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....

==> INTRODUCTION

  COSY_PAK is set of packages and notebooks for classical control and 
(some) modern (state space) control analysis and design methods. The
notebooks in COSY_PAK follow a typical `Control Engineering I' course
taught at many universities around the world for the junior/senior 
level undergraduates. There is NO FEE to use COSY_PAK but certain 
responsibilities are expected of the user (see Copyright notice in the 
README file included below). For starters e-mail / FAX / Mail (Post) 
the registration form included in the README file.

COSY_PAK is available via `anonymous ftp' from

          mishna.esys.cwru.edu (INTERNET No : 129.22.40.23) 

in the /pub directory. 

P.S.: A typical ftp session in UNIX is given after the README file.

--> FTP

     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from

is given at the end of this file.

**********************************************************************

--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)

	In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  
Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working 
LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than 
Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK 
smaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported 
the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the 
COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For 
power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  
the  downside, the disadvantage of this update 
can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version. 


***********************************************************************	
--> For Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  
the directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  
the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 

**************************************************************************
	    
--> Introduction
   
    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems 
analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using 
Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. 
    
    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for 
undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems 
Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have 
also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, 
IBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.

    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  
Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks (""COSY_Notes"") which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books 
listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file. The contents of the notebooks in the ""COSY_Notes"" directory are

--> Compressed Files

        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9
packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:

 COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     		compressed tar file for Unix systems
	
 COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 
				format (requires the   shareware
				 Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 
	
 COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS
    
     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on 
Macintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.


--> Installation of COSY_PAK

 o In UNIX Command line type the following command:

      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -

 o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware
    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.
  
 o In IBM Command line type the following command:

      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip

NOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use 
pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC's may limit the 
directory name characters to eight. In that event type ""pkunzip -o -d 
COSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any 
Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.


     Uncompressing and untarring ""COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z"" or unzipping 
""COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip"" will create a directory called ""COSY_PAK"".
         	
Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
""COSY_PAK"" containing the following three files, four 
sub-directories and their contents:

SUB-DIRECTORIES in ""COSY_PAK"":  
  COSYPAK    - contains control tool box packages 
  MANUAL     - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. 
  COSY_Notes - contains notebooks 
  For_2.0    - contains Laplace transform package from Mathematica 2.1
  		For Mathematica 2.0 users.	 
    		
FILES in directory ""COSYPAK"":
  chap1.m   chap2.m   chap3.m  chap4.m  chap5.m   chap6.m  chap7.m
	
FILES in directory ""COSY_Notes"":
	01_Introduction.ma	  
	02_Math_Model.ma
	03_1_Transient_Response.ma   
	03_2_Transient_Response.ma   
	03_3_Transient_Response.ma   
	04_Steady_State_Response.ma
	05_Root_Locus.ma	  
	06_Freq_Response.ma 
	07_State_Space.ma         
	
FILES in directory ""For_2.0"":
	LaplaceTransform.m     DiracDelta.m	
	SUB-DIRECTORIES in ""COSY_PAK"":	Common
	FILES in directory ""Common"":  Support.m

********************* Important ********************	

	The notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the 
""COSY_Notes"" directory.  To use the notebooks, move the directory `COSYPAK' to  
a 
directory that  Mathematica can recognize :
	
        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine,
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on an Apple Macintosh,
        c:\winmath\packages                  	on an IBM PC.

	At the beginning of the ""Initialization"" cell of each notebook 
in  ""COSY_Notes"" directory, we list the example about how to make 
Mathematica identify the directory:

	(* Initialization of Path *)

	(* Example For a UNIX machine  (Default) *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""/LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For an Apple Macintosh  *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For IBM PC 	
	 *)
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,	
	 {""c:\winmath\packages""}];	
	*)	

Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
Mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$Path' 
setting.

	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory

        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on a Apple Macintosh
        c:\winmath\packages                	on an IBM PC


--> Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in 
the directory For_2.0. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 
into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 


--> Getting started

       After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the ""COSY_Notes"" directory. All notebooks load their own packages. 
Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.

which is a public domain notebook reader. MathReader will at least 
allow you to peruse notebooks but you will not be able to evaluate 
any code fragments.

emm386 noems enables the system to use the ""upper memory"" between 640 and 
1024.  That's a good place for device drivers, DOS kernal, etc.

Hmmm.  I gave two examples which matched your objective criteria, and your
response was some subjective claptrap about them being 'lame'.  You never
did counter the fact that those examples fit your objective criteria.

One wonders who's playing semantic games, here.

I had this problem when I initially installed my sound blaster pro and here's
what the tech support told me.

They told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from
the win31 subdirectory of the soudblaster directory. Now look in the system.ini
file and if any of them say device=xxxxxxx.386 than change it to 
device=*xxxxxxx
Thats should work. Was your system.ini file erased for some reason? That would
be the only reason that I would think that Windoes is giving you the error now.

My Windows 3.1 installation has somehow gone awry.  Whenever I try to run
Windows now, the logo comes up OK, but when it tries to enter Windows
itself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong
graphics mode or something.  It's completely illegible although functional
as I can still exit to DOS with an ALT-E RETURN combination.

I tried to reinstall Windows again, but if you recall, halfway through the
installation process, install takes you into Windows and there my graphics
problem surfaces again so I cannot complete the re-installation.

All this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my
config.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were before
this problem cropped up.

I'm running a 486-33DX with a Diamond Stealth VRAM (I've resinstalled the
Stealth video drivers again but with no luck).  I'm also using QEMM and
Stacker 3.0 but Windows is installed on an un-stacked partition.  And of
course, it worked perfectly before.

Any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.

					 ABSTRACT

	      The format of images created for use by  MS  Windows  3.0/3.1
	      applications  is	documented  in	the MS Windows Programmer's
	      Reference guide.	This guide is intended as a  clearify  some
	      wording	of   the   specifications,   and  to  put  forth  a
	      recommendation among the various alternatives.

	      Please send updates/corrections/suggestions and revisions	 to
	      me.   Please  thank  me  for  writing  this on my own time by
	      keeping my name  with  the  document.   Thank  you  for  your
	      respect.

	      If  desired,  a  PostScript  version  of	this  document	 is

	      This information is free.	 You get more than what you pay for.
	      Don't sue me if I'm wrong.


    OVERVIEW

    The DIB image file format is intended to be a ""Device Independent  Bitmap""
    file  format.  (What Microsoft means by ""Device Independent"" is unclear to
    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit
    pixels.

    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.
    If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-
    swap all short and long integer values.

    By convention, DIB images end in the extension "".BMP"".   This  is  because

				    - 2 -


    they  are  a  super-set of earlier ""bitmap image files"".  Consequently you
    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as ""BMP"" files.

    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three ""flavors""  of  DIB
    images:
	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the
	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for
	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.
	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor
	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.
	 o   Old-style Bitmap images.

    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS

    The DOS DIB images consist of:
	 1.  A ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file	 as  a
	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image
	     file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPINFOHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,
	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows
	     RGBQUAD structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:
	 1.  The same ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file
	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the
	     image file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPCOREHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this
	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a
	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:
	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header
	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.
	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of
	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a
	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header
	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).
	 3.  The image data itself.


    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.

    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.
    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header
    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  ""windows.h""	include	 file.
    Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit
    images.  The five general steps are:
	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER
	     structures the basic image information.
	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the
	     color palette of RGBQUADS.
	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 4 -


	     the ""bfSize"" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the
	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  ""bfOffBits""	field  of  the
	     BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER,
	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).

    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type-
    defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those
    not familiar with MicroSoft C.

    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {
		 WORD	 bfType;
		 DWORD	 bfSize;
		 WORD	 bfReserved1;
		 WORD	 bfReserved2;
		 DWORD	 bfOffBits;
	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;

    The ""bfType"" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves
    to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered
    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the
    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.

    The ""bfSize"" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this
    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times
    the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the
    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be
    calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in
    later.

    Both the ""bfReserved1"" and the ""bfReserved2""  fields  are  always  set  to
    zero.

    The ""bfOffBits"" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data
    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set
    to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times
    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written
    write after the color palette if one exists.


















			      March 15, 1991





				    - 6 -


    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{
		 DWORD	 biSize;
		 DWORD	 biWidth;
		 DWORD	 biHeight;
		 WORD	 biPlanes;
		 WORD	 biBitCount;
		 DWORD	 biCompression;
		 DWORD	 biSizeImage;
		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biClrUsed;
		 DWORD	 biClrImportant;
	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;

    The ""biSize"" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure
    itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to
    determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a
    BITMAPCOREHEADER.

    The ""biWidth"" field is the width of the image in image pixels.

    The ""biHeight"" field is the height of the image in image lines.

    The ""biPlanes"" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out
    as if there was one color plane.

    The ""biBitCount"" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either
    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.

    The ""biCompression"" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is
    compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.
    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how
    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the
    data is not compressed.

    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to
    zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to
    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.

    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be ""biClrUsed"".
    For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the
    possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  ""biClrUsed""
    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may
    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set
    this field to zero.



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 7 -


    COLOR PALETTES

    Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD
    structure is defined in the ""windows.h"" include file as:
	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {
		 BYTE	 rgbBlue;
		 BYTE	 rgbGreen;
		 BYTE	 rgbRed;
		 BYTE	 rgbReserved;
	 } RGBQUAD;
    The ""rgbReserved"" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount
    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is
    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  ""rgbBlue"",  ""rgbGreen"",  or
    ""rgbRed""   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not
    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these
    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color
    composition.



    IMAGE DATA

    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image
    file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and
    certainly was.

    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four
    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel
    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The
    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:

		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;

	---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---

		 bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;


    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.
    The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the
    first line of image data in the file.

    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would
    expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit
    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one
    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.
    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the
    order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 8 -


    an ""RGB"" ordering, a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 ""BGR""
    ordering.

    SUMMARY

    This  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  DIB	 images	  from
    applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines.	If you
    find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on	to  me
    so that I can modify this document accordingly.

It was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it.
Note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
about that, or...

>Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was? 

When I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them (having
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
has very little positive to say about the product, I figured it wasn't
from there...) so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked.
And I was told it was from a survey of registered users.  And I 
posted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came 
from.

Hmm. I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where
they came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is 
""fear, uncertainty & doubt"".)

????  I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't 
pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other
OSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary
features.  I also don't push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in
comp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a 
new os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded 
during release, unless the sales are a total bomb).

I ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. Do you *really*
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?

I just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie
cutter. We don't all think alike.  Yeah, ChuckSt and I have some ""inside""

Yes Russ, there is. 
QuinZip is a Windows version but I don't think it handles
all the functions available in the DOS version.

Last I looked QuinZip could be found on the Monash University (Australia)
mirror site of Cica, so I'd assume it's still on Cica itself
and other mirrors.

Have a look in the /util(s?) directory for a file called

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer
to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename
that you want to create. I've found that putting a line in system.ini in the
ports section with just a path and filename works. The only problem is that
if you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.

You can't customize a command line interface?  Where have you been?  I
can change the prompt, I can make aliases (so someone like me who is
used to say, ls, can type it on my dos machine and still get a
directory listing), and under Unix, if I don't like the command line
interface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh,
sh, etc...)

A decent GUI for all variations of Unix? Lessee... what about Motif?
Or the stuff from MIT? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty
standard. Heck, an xwindows program runs like it likes to -- all the
end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows
with the mouse, and since it is a GUI, it's *graphical* and a bit
easier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing
down our throats for some time now...)

The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users
running windows (all flavors) and the other ""power"" users running Unix
and other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty
much king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo
over to my friends house, and since we both run DOS, he can enjoy it
too.

	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.
	Windows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by
	an errant application (My personal favorite?  Any one of the Corel
	3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly
	a number of times, mostly just running it's own applications.

	For instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading
	with Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard
	VGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that
	I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my 
	.finger.  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless, 
	I fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download
	finished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten
	the pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop
	(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).
	
	Blam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta
	see the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session 
	and got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were
	off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).
	So I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).

	PP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer 
	""connected"" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way--
	it told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it
	was _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. 
	Shutdown and reboot.

	Ok, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...

	Hm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let's see.. Ah, the 
	windows list still comes up.  OK, let's try shutdown again.

	No go.  Huh.

	Alright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow.

	Hmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again.
	Nothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.
  
	In this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but
	OS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s
	been compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_)
	use.


> OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
>(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.


	That's the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on 
	OS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that
	would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs
	that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt,
	task protection or no.  

	For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
	WP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in
	a dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run
	WP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).



>  If windows works for you,
>then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of 
>choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each
>task,


	Please explain.  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is
	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even
	then, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per 
	minute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing 
	this--I've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing).



> and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS,


	Not sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six
	of these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2). 
	Windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the
	disk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency 
	were a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the 
	Intel desktop.  


> some of the
>key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it
>would be more of an even fight.


	On the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence
	that both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to
	them.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine, 
	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows. 
	(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash 
	install).  On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive
	than Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows
	just doesn't like.

Which translates to 7% not satisfied.  I don't think it's the awkward 
recursive deletion that's bugging people, it certainly isn't the nice Windows 
interfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete).

	As far as I've noticed, it's DoubleSpace crashes.

Frankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises 
me!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is 
less likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible 
anyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace isn't it?

Anyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the 
doublespace!

Subject: SUMMARY:  Canon BJ200 vs. HP DeskJet 500
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 401


Hello again,

About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the
Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people
asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I
received.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have
not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so
you can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an
unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a
wide range of comments, each has its own value.  

There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its
price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability
of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new
printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around
summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first
inkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of
re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely
depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets
(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,
that's a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!

Well I bought the BJ 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebate
program on that printer (it ends 5/31), and I bought it from Computer
Discount Warehouse because their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywhere I
looked, and I think it's a HOT printer.  Just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the
output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my
BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed
how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was
several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the
HP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).

I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders
too.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY
was two days.

Good luck!

===========================================================================

I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using
TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for
the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy
paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality
'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find
copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows
driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few
'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType
but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless
the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges
can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.

For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via
the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as
'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The
range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general.

>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.

However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
Epson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing
laser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX
- something I think?

I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The
introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.
 
===========================================================================

About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is
incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever
do stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from
Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had
are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on
cheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you
can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve
inches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The
printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other
complaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for
those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.
The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it
between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine
from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend
who has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone
has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!

Hope I helped!

(360dpi sure looks great!)

  I guess I have some experience with both: I have a BJ-300 at work and a
Deskjet 500 at home.  I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality
are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet
for home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM
Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be
the case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.

  Just my $0.02 worth..

  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not
present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the
translation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the
note.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around
the paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics
resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:
Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and
could not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.
I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no
comparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration
the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.

I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I
spent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at
work this month anyway.

I spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet
BJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:

1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon
2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference
3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.

The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the
BJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.

As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything
big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I
know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the
printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with
the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one
comes from - Microsoft?)

Hope this helps.

Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-))
I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better,
but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at
least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in
other ""new"" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently
available..

I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me
Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one
with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in
printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better..

When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to
inkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.
We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling
qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print
quality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end
up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are
using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out
of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and
that was taken care of very quickly by HP.

Whenever I buy anything I look at what the ""experts"" say, pick out the top
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been
unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a
few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.

I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three
reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I
bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build
a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner
towards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I
tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the
result.

I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour
and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still
readily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my
views/experience:

	1.	I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away
		from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with
		the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.

	2.	I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the
		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes
		they have the expertise.

	3.	The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly
		acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from
		Windows.

	4.	I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured
		typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)
		and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is
		pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...

	5.	The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.

	6.	If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty
		slow with it, God knows what it's like without!

I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily
use.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and
having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.

Hope this is of use.

Just bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with
$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the
DeskJet in print quality.

Speed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures).
         I don't print long docs, though.

Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is
         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up
         close; you can see a lot more ""jaggies"" than on a LaserJet.
         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the
         page/print head in place, I would imagine.

Large docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...
         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.

Drivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn't want to print
         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.

Know nothing of add-on costs.

I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the
sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The
BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare
it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (
depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not
being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since
Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.

Wow, it's funny you should ask this.  I'm a little behind in news reading
so I know this may be late.

  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried
that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is
fantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it
printed DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless you
get 2 inches from the page.

  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette
which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it
under Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to
install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them.

  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut
I felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won't
say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.  Just my
$0.02 worth.

Subject: TCP/IP through Windows 3.1
Lines: 52

I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question:

CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the
         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my
         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it
         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone
         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that
         I type ""telnet uicvm"" or ""tn3270 uicvm"" (either will work) at the DOS
         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then
         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon
         screen. ""TELNET"" and ""TN3270"" are the names of batch files in my SLIP
         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the
         session.

PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I
         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I
         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that
         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me
         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to
         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)
         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP
         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP
         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-
         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when
         that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often
         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center
         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to
         them with more questions.

QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows
         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too
         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that
         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost
         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:

         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1
         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation
         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the
            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp
            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about
            that.

         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true
         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under
         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently
         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet
         session and other applications.

Any information received is appreciated.

Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
config.sys  If you are using W4WW you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space.  Reboot and Novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys.  You might have to remap some
of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives.  Make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set
to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).

Hiyas ALL,

Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I 
couldn't wait to install it. I had gotten an advertisement for it and put 
it aside 
with my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. 
No part of 
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.

	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty 
million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of 
the 
systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're 
willing to 
give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their 
support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings 
of 
Windows 3.1. 
	After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned 
some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop 
Animator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of 

.dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 
100K the 
other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied 

with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll  
to a 
directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll 
in my 
Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) 
When I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the 
applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. Does 
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions 

for trouble-shooting?

I think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS/2.  
Considering that OS/2 is a multi-threaded true multitasking OS and
takes the place of DOS and Windows and more, I actually think the 
requirements for OS/2 are very reasoable.  I also think that anyone
using Windows 3.1 without 8 megs of RAM, a 386-40, and 200 megs of
hard drive space, is beating their head against a wall.  Those are
also legitimate requirements for OS/2.  In fact, the requirements 
for Windows 3.1 and OS/2 are about equal.

The May issue of PC/Computing page 246 has a Windows hint and tips for
just this thing.  You have to edit the WIN.INI file and add a couple
of lines.  I tried it and it works.  I actually made my Title bar
and iconized text, and icon text smaller.  On my monitor it works well.
You can select a larger font also.  You edit the WIN.INI file with
a font name in your system directory.  Read the article because I would
not want to retype it here in case I type errored and caused your
system problems.

I'm not sure that this is possible due to the way the Mac writes the 800k
disk.  I think the way the sectors are set up are different enough that a
PC 3.5"" can't read it.  This is a hardware problem which software cannot
correct.  Hope this helps and correct me if I'm wrong.

Hello All!

    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -
secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?

These are perfectly valid points and I agree. I'm glad we (MS) are starting
to remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future 
releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the 
mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over
the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS
(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.
The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people
until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the 
wayside.

Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to
be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either
stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that
point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the
short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS
3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.
Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will
offer even more in terms of ""real"" OS features (I work on NT and have no
real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
few years ago).

	...Dave

Of course these are my opinions. If you want MS's opinions, as a PR person.

Well, I thought that highmem.sys would do that too. I just took out emm386  
of my config.sys, and I'm still loading my other drivers high (mouse, vga  
shadow bios, dos-key etc.) I haven't checked mem/c, but I believe I have  
managed to load them high (ie between 640KB and 1024KB).

Also, ever since I took out emm386, windows loads slightly faster, I get  
about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows (I'm running 386 enhanced with 4  
Meg RAM, 7 Meg swap) and I got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem  
(before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl-alt-del after exiting  
windows). 

I would really like to keep emm386 out of my config.sys. Anybody else have  
info on this???

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not unreasonable, since the SMARTDRV packaged with DOS 6 is version 4.1.
Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being
executed from the DOS directory.

Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not,
I don't know what might cause the startup delay.  My testbed for DBLSPACE
(which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't
eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in 
about 20 seconds from the ""Starting MS-DOS"" herald to the end of the
AUTOEXEC.BAT execution.  I don't have handy a system with a more
realistic volume of data to time.

The easiest way to do this is if you can send the files accross the network. 
This is much easier going from a Mac to a PC because you don't have to worry
about losing the resource fork of the file, often a problem when sending binary
files from a PC to a Mac.

Sorry, I don't have the demo, but I do have the program and have been
using it for the past few weeks.  Since I now have Dos 6 as well, I
don't use many of the features of PCT4Win.  But I do so use:
	- the PCT Desktop with drag and drop printing, folders in
          folders, and multiple desktops
	- the file manager which is far superior to win 3.1's fm.

Hi everybody out there,
I just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of WindowsNT
and still am not able to boot up that system. The final step
achieved is the display of IO-error 0x0069. But, since this is
the beta release of the SDK for NT and not of NT, Microsoft does
not include a manual on the OS itself, explaining what this
error means of what I can do to get rid of. My configuration
is: 
Mainboard     Hauppauge 4860-25, rev. A7 (a 486 with socket for i860)
              28megs of memory (512k*36,1M*36,2M*36)
AMI EISA SCSI controller (15series), latest bios, 16MB cache 
              ST41200N hard disk
              Syquest 555 removable disk
              Toshiba 3301 CD ROM drive
ProAudio Spectrum Plus 16
Longshine Ethernet card LCS8634 (NE2000 comp.)
ET4000 graphics card, 1Meg (ColorImage5)
The system is running fine under DOS and Windows 3.1 etc, but
trying to do the setup for NT,
- automatic setup does not recognize controller (AHA1542-compat.)
  when adding manually, NT complains not finging any CD-ROM drive
- the manual setup (WINNT) does not copy everything from CD to HD,
  does not recognize controller, but takes it manually.
  Setup continues until it tries to boot. Then it starts loading
  several stuff from disk (seems to fing the HD), but messing up
  with that damned IO-Error 69.
I took away all IO cards not essential, but that did not make any
effect.
Anybody got any ideas? Help would be greatly appreciated.

I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list.  But we have
strayed from the original topic.  Our computer environment is pretty split
between Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But
there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users
here.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter
which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there
is no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been 
inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity
in a DOS program to selectively transport the files.

The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
windows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is 
in a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite
clear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.

Make sure you use the small fonts driver & not the large fonts driver. Check

I've had the same problem with a Maxtor 7213A.  Turned off
smartdrive, 32 bit disk access, etc.  This same disk aborts
Norton Speed Disk (NU 4.5), up to 8 times, requesting NDD to be
run when attempting to defrag drive.  At Some peoples' suggestion
I reformatted my drive and reloaded DOS 5.0, Win 3.1 from
scratch.  A few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1
beta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem, So I tried this
drastic solution.  When the problem reoccurred, I didn't have the
brains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive.

I get arround the annoyance by copying my *.grp files to *.gro.
when I get the message, I run file manager and copy the
offeniding group files from *.gro ove rthe *.grp.  Then I quit
and restart windows(If the group is an often used important one.)

This really sucks.  But I'm pretty sure that the problem is the
drive (especially with the NSD problem).  I will be going with
out over 66% of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks, while
the guy I bought the disk and system from, goes over it and
either fixes it or replaces the drive.  I can't wait to have a
system that will run consistently with all hte goodies!

to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it.

I also ftp'd the game dare2dream for windows (from cica) and its music
won't play either - I get the same dialog box.

The MIDI Mappers that I have are ATI Ext MIDI, ATI OPL3 MIDI, and Vanilla.
I have tried using all three.

Any help, suggestions, shoulders to cry on, etc. would be appreciated
very much.

Danny...

While working on my shareware toolbar, I found myself 'eating' resources,
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK, and specifically the debug
kernel. Once you have all the SDK stuff installed, (this also comes with
VC++), you run 'n2d' which does a 'normal-to-debug' swap. The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower, but you then execute the command
DBWIN, and let it report to you what is going on. You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to, and possibly about other
peoples Apps (is that OPA?..I'm sorry). 

If this doesn't make sense, repost, or e-mail me

Dos 5 never used the area $E000 - $EFFF, as well as some others. If you have 
any cards that use this are (such as a LAN card), you might get this 
problem.

Use the X=$E000-$EFFF in your EMM386.EXE line in config.sys. If you run 
MemMaker then instruct it retain inclusions and exclusions.

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputes
that OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an 
individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that
question. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2
and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse
set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
work. Go to your local computer store to answer this one.
I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This
is where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won
the single user PC war the next one will be the client server
war and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0.
Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be
attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'
of the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
is fun watching and arguing about it tho.

Its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and ""stable"" in
general than serial mice.  If I remember correctly, its because
of the differences in how the interrupts are handled, as well as
the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus
as opposed to a (9600 bps?) serial connection.

Is this just a general problem, or is it associated with a specific

Excuse me? Are you one of those people who *enjoy* working w/win? Come talk

If you wait until May the 18th you will be able to buy the new OS/2
2.1 since it will be released at Comdex that day. It will run Windows
3.1 apps and Windows enh. mode. If you can't wait, then you can ftp a
6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product.

When you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task. The real power of OS2
lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch.

Happy benchmarking.

 I thought I'd reply to this, though I ain't brad.  AT any case, a lot
of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to
.bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop
(shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think,
where VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I""ll
post a corection).


This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you
have to rename it.

NOW, another thing....
this is from the windows' FAQ:

your file has to be less than 64 K
( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than
about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know).

Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size
is.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a
way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,
such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about
this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the
filename). 

ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.

These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory.

Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your
new win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from a
directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of
the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.


Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).

You are pervert.. Ok vi is not CUA but it has a powerful set of commands.
One for all it has 26 separate clipboard (and not only one ofor all kind of
data like Windows does).
The only problem is to Know the commands (the keyboard shortcut).
I am quite fast with the pc keyboard... and I usually use all fingers to digit
so when I use a editor I do not want to leave the keyboard and use the mouse
every time I need a special Function on the menu or to use the arrow keys
that are away from the usual position of my hands on the keyboard......
In my situation vi is very powerful and I'm searching to a vi editor

Excellent suggestion, Ron.  And as a further comment on DOS 6, if
you decide to install Windows standalone configuration completely,
in more than 1 directory on your hard drive, and use DOS 6 to
jump to a specific copy for each user, you could be saving yourself
many megs of disk space if you use the SETUP /N and /A technique!!

It's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was

I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,
but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice
before 2.0 was released).

Hmm. Are you sure?  I'm speaking from my own experience as an
OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,
research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).
Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).

Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to ""sell"" 
readers on our products (which would conflict with the ""no-ads"" 
philosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have.

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,
members of the BORG.

Autodesk Animator is a good tool. The one I like is Show Partner/FX. If
you want it, I could give a copy to you. I did a lot of advertising with it -
it lets you create both graphics (ANY resolution) and text frames, run it all
as a ""film"", you can make choices and include music - I guess that's just
what you need. If you're really interested, email me.

This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.

I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to
customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their 
command line.

So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them
that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has
done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception.

Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to
all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

Summary: How to get SLIP going on your PC ....

I have been posting monthly ""how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC"" posts for a 
few months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of 
posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.

This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota
PHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with 
PHONE. 

For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at

-- begin SLIP.TXT --
Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here
are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the
Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring your Modem:

a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)
   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use
   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program
   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit
   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.
   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.

   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a
         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.

b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done
   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of
   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the
   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and
   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with
   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver
   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a
   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.
   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and
   batch file examples.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring the SLIP drivers:

There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available
CSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver
SLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver
SLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)
ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)
UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)

Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or
ETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:

a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART
b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others
   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a
   long FTP transfer.
c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode
d) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with
   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.

Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)
a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:
   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1
   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600
b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the
   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual
   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS
   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all
   use this virtual driver at 0x60.
   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in
   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.
   pktint.com

Instructions for SLIP8250.COM:
a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern
   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware
   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.
b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a
   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.
   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600
c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x
   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM
   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM
   pktint.com

Instructions for ETHERSL.COM:
If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You
will have to DELETE the line ""device=*vcd"" from the [386Enh] section
of SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm
applications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped
characters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not
recommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:
   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring Windows 3.1:

a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]
   section.
   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.
       COM1Base=03F8
       COM1Irq=4
       COM2Base=02F8
       COM2Irq=3
       COM3Base=03E8
       COM3Irq=5
       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,
       but double-clicking on the ""Ports"" icon.
   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer
       COM1Buffer=10000
   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish
       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that
       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to
       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch
       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value
       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.
       COM1AutoAssign=0
       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.
       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under ""Device Contention"", set
       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to
       ""Never Warn""
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional notes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each
SLIP session?

I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user
a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI
each time that I establish a SLIP connection.

If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,
please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the
configuration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP
will not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a
situation such as this, you must do the following:

Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:

[net]
name=
ip=
netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)
arptime=20
packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)

Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file
""attrib +r qvtnet.ini""

Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address
that you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the
general configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and
IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],
and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not
be saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.

A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address
assignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)
Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.
Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a
file called ""myip"".  Another file ""noip"" is essentially a complete
QVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step ""myip""
and ""noip"" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of
Victor's batch file is provided below:
=====================================================
slipper com2
pktint.com
bootpq -i ""ip=\""%%s\""""  >> myip
bootpq -i ""My IP# is: %s""
copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini
del /q myip
@echo off
echo .
echo Ready to run WinQVTnet
=====================================================
For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor
Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)

QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?

PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes
immediately if used with ETHERSL.COM

PKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet
simulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:

The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you
use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with
applications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).

[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]

lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)
lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)
lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)
lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)
pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)

Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within
Windows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is
directed to the file ""popmail.bat"".  This is what popmail.bat reads
like:

pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60
cd \popmail
popmail
cd \
pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60
exit                    causes the DOS window to close

I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications
like PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS
sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example
within two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for
Gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each
instance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?

I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with
a reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these
conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and
being used as follows:
a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session
b) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session
c) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS

I get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring
compressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with
SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session
is active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session
is active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same
files.

While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,
for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the
performance hit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode

In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the
applications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications
that required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3

When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,
I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads
""IP:incorrect packet type"" or ""IP:bad version number"".  This does not
seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on
loss of performance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with
C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?

In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with
C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --
Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him
know.  Chances are that he can fix it.

In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is
kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2

(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)

I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate
ETHERSL.COM

This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a
packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box
at a time.

So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a
medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library
of Medicine).

ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP
cd \gm6
search
cd \
termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP
exit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows

If you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have
any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing
the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no
problem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no
problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PHONE Script Files:

The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on
writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than
the University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script
that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.

Background:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,
and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP
session with the following command ""slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu"",
followed by my password -- again.

Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -

How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?

The quick answer -- there is no ""clean"" way.  Below is a batch file
hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this
example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a
batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you
plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,
port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,
CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory
or in your path ...

All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection
using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the
connection, and unload the driver when you are done ...

The IBM XGA SVGA VESA driver is on the 2.02 reference diskette, available
from the IBM BBS.  It's also on Compu$erve, or you can bang on your sales

Do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the DOS display and then back or 
create a temp. DOS window?

If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  I'm afraid 
I don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it.

It's fully compatible with ver. 2.04g and very functional.

It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but
the only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to 
challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris
or OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level.  Everybody
would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS/2 app on
an OS/2 system, they usually just can't afford a Unix system because
of the high prices for good Unix software.

I had posted that it came from a survey of registered users, I 
double-checked with a friendly neighborhood marketing type and
found there were actually two surveys. One of randomly selected

Sounds like a memory conflict problem, which can cause truly weird symptoms 
like these. Call Dell tech support (or better, post to them on CSERVE if you
have an account) and get the memory range(s) used by video RAM on your
machine. The block windows from using those ranges with an
EMMEXCLUDE= statement in the 386Enh section of SYSTEM.INI. You probably
should include a statement excluding the same range from EMM386 or whatever
memory manager you use in CONFIG.SYS.

Dell ""installs"" Windows on the machines they ship, but the installation doesn't
consist of much more than  copying the files to a hard disk. You still have
to do the work. And the fact that you have the problem in Enhanced
mode but not standard strongly suggests a high memory conflict.

It depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that
comes standard with windows, or with an icon from some other icon manager.

Well, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the 
item by clicking once on it, click on 'File' and then on 'Properties'.
You should see a box which says 'Change icon'. Click on it. You are going
to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). If you don't like
any of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file
'moricons.dll' Select it. Browse through the icons presented, and just
double click on your desired icon.

If you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager,
say iconPower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your
screen, where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace.
When you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding
the mouse button down, pull this icon over the one you wish to change.
And thats it!

regards

I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as
a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as ""foo.txt ."" I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
""foo.txt"" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems.

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move ""foo.txt"" to a specified directory, rename it using
the current date and time, and delete the original ""foo.txt .""

In other words, ""foo.txt"" gets renamed as ""5012300"", say, on May 1
at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and
""foo.txt"" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec
macro points to it.

My main question is this: 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
time/date variable in the new filename?

I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good
success in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of
people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command
(a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear
people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in
Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:

  ""JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if
  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for
  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives
  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use
  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.""

Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I
have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems
that have been ""mounted"" using join.

In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It
wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then
delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.

Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic
place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the
joined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original
*.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you
search your disk systems, the document is gone.

I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box
when JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg
ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an ""ls"" on the c:\temp
dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to 
reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think
this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw
DOS.

So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not
be as robust you would like.

Wouldn't it be real great to ""mount"" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main
file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,
JOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch
to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.

It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would
avoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was
meant for casual, even ignorant users, so ""mounting"" all the drives in
one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry
this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant 
users -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs
a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.

I solved my problem.  I still do not understand why it happens ths

For some reason when I define the following functins in the class

functions are not defined.  When I placed these two in a separate
source file and compiled them, the problem went away.  Any ideas what
happen?  Are the functions that are defined in the class construct all
inline ?  Is this the problem?

Read one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it

Some of them have very limited budgets.

< rest deleted >

As a followup to my post let me add that:

I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance.
However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the
application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from
within an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their
site-specific ""batch profile"" into a dataset within our product, specifying
the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,
etc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is
written to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and
run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as
the job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the
interactive session.

As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80
characters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in
batch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a
problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.
MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single
command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is
*STANDARD* with OS/2).

The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not
within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.
Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party
companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.
And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative
script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption
that they have anything other than what comes with NT.

I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like ""Is vi
available for Windows?"") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and
***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is
it a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites.

One last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,
i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run
there.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific
commands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment
on these commands, I would appreciate it.

Thanks again for the help,

 MIRROR is one of those DOS commands that didn't survive the change 
 from DOS 5.0.  It's been dropped, along with BACKUP, JOIN, EDLIN  
 and a couple other crummy old DOS commands.  You can still use the
 5.0 commands if you absolutely have to, but they are not included
 on the 6.0 distribution disks.

 However, in MIRROR's case, I'm 99.9% certain that it does not know
 anything about DoubleSpaced drives...

	WinZip 4.0 (ftp.cica.indiana.edu:pub/pc/win3/(util?) ). It is
a shell (it DOES call DOS ), but a very, very good one. It will also
do arc, arj and lzh. It fully supports PKZIP 2.04 . Try using it...
It might be a shell --very unobtrusive--, but that also means you dont
need to update it with every every-other-letter-of-the-alphabet version
of PKZIP... :)
Hope it helps....

On all 1.44Mb drives (both Mac and PC), the disk spins at a constant
RPM.  On 800k Mac disk drives, the spin rate of the disk is varied so 
that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed; a slower rotation
for the outer tracks, and a faster rotation for the inner tracks.  A PC
needs special controller hardware to make this happen.

  Well, I've come into some money and want to buy CD-ROM, sound board
and speakers.  I have not kept up on any material relating to sound
boards and CD-ROM's because until now I never thought I'd have enough
money.  

  So can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good
package including CD-ROM, sound, and speakers (and software I
suppose)... OR since I don't REALLY need the CD-ROM right now give me
some good ideas for sound boards and speakers.  Those I could REALLY
use now.  I have looked at SoundBlaster Pro, which costs about as much
as I think I want to spend on a board (~$120), and I've looked at the
Gravis Sound board, which is about $140 and I don't know the
adv/disadv of either of these boards.  

  Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound, and to
use in Windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  So any
concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would
be greatly appreciated.  If anyone else is interested in this info I
would be glad to summarize responses and post.  

  And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right
direction and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth.  Thanks!

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but I've used the
shareware program, PaintShop, to convert between the two.  You can download
it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called
or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try
scanning the index files).

To convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a
""Save as...""  Select ""Windows bitmap"" and ""Compressed"" (or is it ""RLE""?)
Whatever it is, it's fairly intuitive...

Sorry I don't have all the details, but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb
terminal and can't do much researching...Good luck!

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board.  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I
would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  

So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
not.

If it's any consolation, I had a similar problem. As I recall, if I exited
from a DOS session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a
scrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that). It only
started happening after I used IconTitleFaceName in WIN.INI to change the
desktop font to Arial. So I stopped exiting from DOS sessions while in
full-screen mode.

My Mac used to do something similar. Aren't computers weird?

Less than 1/2 of mailorder price!

I have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars
mail order.  They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just
some scans with a silly EPS wrapper!)  They are:

1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images).
   This costs a thousand bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as
   high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art,
   etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R.
   library as higher.  Totem's art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other's
   are B&W.  It's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion.

2. C.A.R. Graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can
   purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size).
   This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as
   very high quality, but it's only B&W.

3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags).  This costs
   about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as very high quality
   (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which).  Some of
   the images are color, but most are B&W.

For what it's worth, all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats.
They are readable on Mac's and PC's.  Additionally, Totem's will mount native-
NeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC
filesystems.  I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines (I've owned
all three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago).

Also, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business
(and I've seen lots).  Also, Totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color
library around, although I like 3G's color art better.

I want $850 for everything.  Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as
VISA/MC charge.  If you pay by VISA/MC, I'll ship pre-paid in the continental U.S.
If I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee.

Reason for selling: No longer have DTP business.

It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing
budgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that
COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who
use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they
have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked
pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually
likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  That's okay, marketing
isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's
superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot
more to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they
could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even
use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with
compatability issues and absconding with the technology.

DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch
marketing and vendor agreements.  The ""mediocre"" was excusable in the
early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years
to play with it.

An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in
the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and
programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least
have the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0
and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?

Using the software you're using, I agree with you there.  What I did:
I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same
as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the 
DOS ""backup"" command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the 
""system"" diskette, and use DOS ""restore"" to read in that much, then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your
case), overwriting what I've just restored.  That allows me to keep
this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization
on the ""real"" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.

Seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup
utility on a ""system"" floppy.  Then you could restore it all on one ""go"".

(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over
a week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)

Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the
pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story
but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the
potential pitfalls of ""upgrading"" to DOS 6 that I have been able to
notice after only about a week of playing around with it.

My envorinment
==============

TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk
System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments
CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel
Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments
Smart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-
Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs

After ""updgrading"" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things
became so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the
process of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.


Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive
==================================================

While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain
applications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is
that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to
consider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)
and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).

The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from
factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when ""upgraded"" to
DOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of
more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew
that DS compression must cost something.

Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually
*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than
I/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings
in I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large
random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.

While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or
sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on
WinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.

The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv
on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective
statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or
even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and
slow disk I/O'.

This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why
'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.


Double Space and Windows
========================

DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you
wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that
matter even check on its usage -- try ""fasthelp dblspace"" in a dos box
within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you
get.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.

Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to
file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed
floppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed
floppy if you dont know how to.)


DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM
==============================================

Defragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited
patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.
This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take
no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)
but it took 12 minutes.

I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran
faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this
had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)
module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,
and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After
disabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.


Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots
====================================================================

In the readme.txt file, you can find the the following

	Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup
	for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in
	your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you
	run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.

If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it
means ""disable all power saving features of your notebook"".  Why would
anyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only
does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the
readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what
else) are crippled by the TI's power saver.

It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If
there indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI
programmers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have
to guess as to who are the idiots.

By the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE
in DOS6, when you check the status, it says:

	Power Management Status
	-----------------------
	Setting =  ADV: MAX
	CPU: idle 60% of time.

This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook
when I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in
iconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all
for itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is
such an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating
system or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%
idle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type
of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'
example of our times!


Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming
===================================================

I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of
addpath statements like this:

	set PATH=C:\DOS
	...
	set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN
	...
	set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS
	...
	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN
	...
	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%

Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old
one (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every
path statement, and prepends C:\DOS to its value.  As a result, my
resultant path has so many DOS's.

If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add
the new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement
containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.
(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a
directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)

Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)
decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and
prepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it
would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.

I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft
representative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he
specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the
information to him as he did not have access to internet.

Now that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement
with %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement
should not be touched for any reason?

As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to
understand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:

	set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE
	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%
	loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM

Guess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with

	LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM

Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its
parameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.


DOS 6 Software Quality
======================

DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,
you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the
commands that come with it.

I am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to
use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont
within a week, I will post how you can create this ""ghost"" file.

Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a
particular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)
programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find
it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft ""tests the quality"" of
their products.

I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to ""test quality""
when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but
can only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any
form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs
that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond
repair!

Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk
is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the
defragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated
when I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive
defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and
with no new file creation since.

Microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you
admit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we
should watch out for if we have already used DS.

No, I'd rather not.  First of all, I don't have exact figures, and I don't
want to disclose how I know this.  However, I will say that Jim Francis
from Microsoft just posted a figure of $26 million (payment from IBM to
Borland) and that's somewhere in the range that I've heard.

While I do not think he is lying, I also feel hesitant to take anybody ""on their

and misinformations and misconceptions and outright lies flying around the 
advocacy newsgroups, I do not trust any unsubstantiated rumor or claim 
- especially from any employees of IBM's OR MicroSoft, or anyone who seems to
have a vested interest.

      manage your groups, change your cursor and icons on the fly,
      constant status of RAM and resources, ""Quick-menu"" (a drop-down

Actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops
mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows.  PC
Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group
does its development under OS/2.  Another trade rag did an article
recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations
with SoftPC to test out their work.  SCO Unix is and has been a
reasonably popular development platform for DOS, Windows, and even OS/2
apps.  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for
development work, IMHO, and apparently others agree.

There was a post about something similar a while back.  It seems windows
does *not* take it upon itself to free up any sys. resources an
applllication is using when that application is done.  That job is left
entirely to the application.  that is, the application has to clean up
after itself when it quits.

Anyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which  will
clean up sys. resources when an application quits (mother.zip???).

I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS
(and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.  As a programmer, I
agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things.  It's annoying, too.
But when just a Windows user, I don't think about it much.  And, I doubt many
other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document,
calcing a spreadsheet, etc...It works and they get their work done.

Just a neutral comment:
It's funny, I think, how arguments about Windows vs OS/2 sound so very
similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that.
It's somehow very personal to people.  Convictions are irrational and
there's nothing wrong with that--it's just...interesting.

Microsoft has a division called Microsoft Consulting that does what
IBM FEs (field engineers) do.

However, neither company just up and sends consultants to client sites. 
Both companies charge very high hourly rates for on-site consulting unless
the client has already paid an annual service contract.

It's the applications that do this.  Unfortunately, even the applets
that ship with Win31 seem to have this problem (I've seen it in
Solitaire, for example).

None that I know of.  If an application doesn't give back the
resources, they are lost and gone forever, pending a restart of
Windows.

If the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them
don't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do
about it.

No.  This is a problem with the applications, usually.

There are books written on this one.  In general, just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit.  Unfortunately, I
understand that VB will *internally* lose resources for you, so
there's no way to avoid this entirely.

There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages
to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on
the resource pool.

  Hi.  One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem.  His mouse
works fine in DOS applications, if you load them from the C: prompt.
Under Windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move.  Even
if you load a DOS app under Windows, the mouse doesn't work.

  The computer is a Zeos 386SX-20 w/Diamond Speedstar VGA running MS
DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1.  Mouse driver is Microsoft's 8.2.  I've tried
switching the mouse from COM1 to COM2, I've tried a different mouse,
I've reinstalled MOUSE.DRV, and I can't get the blamed thing to work.
The only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works
perfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional
parallel and serial port.  Could that cause the problem? 

  Thanks in advance for any help.

	This is one of the trickiest problems w/ Win 3.1 ... Personally I run
Telix 3.2 for DOS under Windows just fine (and 've been waiting for the Win

I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of
them w/ big problems... Some of the stuff you have to lookout for: 
1) ALWAYS run the prog thru a .PIF, never by calling its .exe, 2) In the .PIF
_always_ toggle on _lock_application_memory_ --actually this is something
MS points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading
3) Go under Ctrl Panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your COM ports 'Alway Warn'
--it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4) Check where
are u running the mouse from - com port - 5) check the com port addresses from
your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel/Ports/(Setup?)/Advanced..
These might help u... If yu still have problems, get $100 and buy Procomm+Win..,
:) Hope it helps somehow...

Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures
of success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think
in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.
I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.

I also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call
them are highly technical. Look around in the real world people don't want
to GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their 
job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need 
a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and the
multitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does
this and does it WELL. We are running 150 pc's loaded with a complete
suite of mostly MS Windows applications in an administrative business
function on a Novell network running all software off the server.
It does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick
Windows again. 
Again I repeat to MS keep doing what you are doing. You are doing a great
job.

When using the windows terminal application, the only way

then go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine.
(I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't have
anything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual
for all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is 
jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't
use the second serial port and the modem at the same time,
but I'm not using the second serial port anyway.
Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem
and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end

Development of what?  In-house apps?  Maybe, but  certainly not apps
to be sold on an open market.  Statistics like that are laughable,
because they may simply mean that there are not enough shrink-wrapped
usable apps for UNIX and they have to be developed disproportionately
often as compared to the installed UNIX base.

Basically:
Windows prefers extendend memory instead of expanded (more work to do for Win)
and if no application desperatly needs EMS, you should leave emm386
with a ""REM"" in your config.sys.

Subject: Upgrading to Windows NT

Organization: Performance Systems Int'l
X-Mailer: PSILink-DOS (3.3)
Lines: 65

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice.

First a general description of the machine as follows:
 Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache
      (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it)
 Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256)
 ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board
 primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller
 secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller
 tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller
 planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port
 Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller
  future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface.
 Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board
 (ugly dos software drives the latter)

Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken
and Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio
work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo,
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files.  Also I use
Stacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she 
won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from 
Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files.  

I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the 
shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can
hope can't I, after all, I have work to do).

The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and 
hardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the 
upgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I
still need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) 
from some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm
allergic to command lines!  I plan to run a ""pure"" NT system.  Also, will 
NT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite 
Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the 
system (It's cramped now).

I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT 
version?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk
will be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)
a comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask 
Chili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd
rather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without
DOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?

Any feedback or advice (including ""forget NT"" with good reasons) is much
appreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better
multitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),
and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe
there are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing 
about them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)

Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.

Thanks,
Nathan Gregory

While the 64K limit may not be _necessary_ limitation, they probably fall
within the category of 'reasonable' limitations.  If you find yourself
trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text, it's probably
time take a good look at your program's design.

>Why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory

In what way is 8192 a 'small' number?  It seems to me that you'd hit the
wall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global
handles, unless, of course, you're abusing GlobalAlloc.


And _please_ don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the
resources available under other operating systems.  All systems have
limits.  The question is whether or not the limits are _reasonable_.  So
far, you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows'
limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems.

For the most part, this newsgroup is ""attack"" oriented.  Microsoft has been
attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the
intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc.  ANYONE
would get defensive when being baselessly attacked.  We are human beings as
well.  You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might
feel is unwarranted is leveled.

You CAN print to a file from an HP (or any other printer).  Just go into
the Printers section of your Control Panel.  Select the printer you want
to re-direct to a file, and click on Connect.  Then choose :FILE as the
port to connect the printer to.

When you print from any application to that printer, Windows will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the
printout.

It's pretty easy.

Good luck!

This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago. My HD was stacked
with Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of
the HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with
'funny' names). In other words: it is probably just the doubledisk part of
Dos6 that is troublesome. 

I now use Stacker v 3.0, and so far I have had no trouble.

Come on fellows! The format is quite plainly explained in the manuals.
It's in the ""Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures,

manuals) pages 232-241 (depending what you need).

Subject: logic of backup?
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL
Lines: 25

I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to re-install
everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't I?!).
I am using a windows-based backup program (actually Norton), and I 
began wondering about the logic of this.  Sure, if I accidentally delete
a file, I can get it from the archive.  But what if my disk crashes again?
I would not be able to start windows to run the backup program!  (Note,
by crash, I mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine
from booting properly.  I think I gave up too early, but I didn't have
the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was.  My
hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. Yeah right...)  This whole scenario
is complicated by the fact that I am using Stacker.

So I think there are 2 possibilities:

   1) I'm right.  If my disk really crashes, I would at least have to
      re-install DOS and Windows to get the backup program working.
   2) I'm wrong.  There is an easy way to make a ""mirror"" of a hard disk
      that can easily restore it's state from scratch.

The polls are open...

Subject: Local Windows .vs. Shared Windows (Discussion)
Organization: The Ohio State University, Department of Physics
Lines: 110

I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows
from a Novell administrator's point of view.
 
I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they
(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,
the LOCAL setup (described below) as the ""most advantageous installation"".
If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.
 
The LOCAL Windows Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the
resources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation,
he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.
Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers
are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.
 
Advantages:
- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to
  the local access of main Windows files.
- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point
  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing
  and reduce the cost of down-time.
- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard
  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network
  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster
  access than local ones.
- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about
  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the
  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.
 
Disadvantages:
- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk
  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can
  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.
- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to
administer.
  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of
  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.
- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system
  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for
  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.
- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup
  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.
  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be
  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable
  applications and *not* user data.
 
The SHARED Windows Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure
described above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of
files to individual ""user"" directories.  These directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network ""home"" directory.  The bulk of the
Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory
(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout
their Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include
group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.
 
Advantages:
- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As
  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this
  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.
- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,
  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct
  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.
- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files
  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with
  all driver updates.
 
Disadvantages:
- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network
  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the
  speed of Windows.
- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's
  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs
  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will
  usually not be able to save their work.
- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files
  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a
  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows
  files alone.
- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation
  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being
  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).
  
The Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows
userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have
setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money.
 
I would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should
apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how
Windows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy
backup and administration but this is ""putting all eggs in one basket"";
if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.
 
Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to
hear from people with ""actual"" working experience with users and network
administration.

COM files are limited to a total size of 64KB.  Thus, win.cfn plus vgalogo.log 
plus your RLE file must be less than 64KB.  Thus, your RLE file should be 
around 30KB.

Here is another hint:

I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,
show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very
convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files
I use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does
also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.
This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university. 
The drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the
program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion
sched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19
(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this
windows program start.

It certainly smacks of that! Remember the ""POLL"" that you quoted saying that
you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0? Care to recall how
unbiased the sample set was? That post sure looked like FUD....and coming

Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very

That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more 
defensive people in my life. Moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage
this too, IMHO.

Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for
MS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing.
I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ... I have not doubts about their 
abilities, just about the ethics of their marketing practices.

You don't, and never had to.  That's what enhanced shells are for.  Remember

I don't think they deliberately crippled the project.  On the other hand, it 
IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on
top of DOS.  I mean, you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC.  With 
XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna

Many thanks to those who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I have
had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested
in geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description.  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the 
early part of the century.  This may take me some time to do (in my
limited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested, 
when it is ready.

(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts
for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me.  I contacted Michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and
that he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging 
IR 100 (about $160) for each one.

pbryant@ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'.  These are ""Durrow"" and ""American 
Uncial-Normal"".  I don't know where you can get these but I don't
think that they have the effects I am looking for.

Finally, rhiannon@netcom.com (Rhia) mentioned that the ""Meath"" font
included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package
is very much like what I was describing.  I faxed Casady & Greene for
info but got no reply.

So that's it.  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available.

I do not know of any ""VGA"" type cards that have BNC outputs but, EXTRON
sells a VGA to BNC cable set that works good with my 5FG.  If you are
trying to optimize the display with a good video card try contacting #9,

I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  
Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track 
Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.

First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  
are.

What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  
IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  
be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there?

Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  
got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  
why I should load this driver?

Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.

Keep the swap file on the IDE.  32-bit access is worth a fair amount more
than 13%.

Please research carefully.  Just because a fax modem behaves like
a printer on a ""local"" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality 
when a ""local"" machine has fax software printing to a ""remotely
installed"" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the 
fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's
peculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware
interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager
program merely ""intercepts"" the print job and spools it to
it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To
software, it appears the job was ""printed"".  Print Manager 
plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.

Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were
up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be
required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.

Good luck.

I've seen this problem several times. It was always the result of the little

Very well indeed.  At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch
an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  It drops
a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
one frame update every 30 seconds.  An ISA Graphics+ was able to do ""Zoom by
2"" without any perceptible performance penalty.  It is the best performance
I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which
uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA
bus at any point).

Wow, what did you use it for?  Single-tasked word processing?
I have 8 files loaded right now and a 29-MB virtual machine (12MB of
RAM). My friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a
floppy in the background.  Many unix people love OS/2 because they are
used to multi-tasking systems.

I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and I've had a little bit of 
experience with it now.  In general, it feels *FAST*, although this
is the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are 
impressive.

With my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following
WinTach 1.0 results:


Card				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATI Graphics Ultra		13.5	14.5	19.1	25.0	18.0
ATI Ultra+ (no aperture)	11.2	13.8	10.7	20.9	14.1
Hercules Graphite VL		16.1	67.8	41.4	52.8	44.5

Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB
had an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as
fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.

As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-
redraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly
heavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2
seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson's
contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex
Micrografx Draw document.

So far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.
The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  And
I didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules'
software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for
just $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).  Call 800-532-0600 if you want to
give it a try -- I'm a happy customer now!

This is the part that usually gets me. While I am set to make money, there usually
are OTHER things to be considered and debated. That is the purpose of life.
If you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification,
usually you'll end up with Japanese (or whoever that is competitive) owing your

When:  Wednesday, May 5th
       7 pm to 9 pm
			 
			 
NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,
only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue
of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a ""Hot Prospect"". Now, NeXT is nearing release
of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to
the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and
Motorola hardware.

NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression
486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo
in San Francisco.

The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are  
interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by!

For a brief summary of what NEXTSTEP offers, see the May 11th issue of 
PC Magazine, page 66.

Nonsense.  Sorry, I make fun of Windows all the time, but the above is

Generally, the second or third major release usually takes care of it.
My advice, based on plenty of personal experience, is to never buy the
first version of anything from Microsoft.  This includes major version
number upgrades from previous releases, such as Microsoft C 6.00.
Always wait at least for the ""a"" upgrade or slipstream upgrade if
you're going to buy it.

Hello Netters

	I recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer.
The other day, I bought the COMPUTER SHOPPER mag.  I was looking through
printer review section and noticed the WINPRINTER800.  The machine is 
incredibly low priced for all the features it has 

			800 dpi!
			8Meg RAM
			Postscript compatable
			envelope printing

My question is does anyone have one of these or know why the price is so
cheap?  I would appricaiate it if someone would pass on their knowledge
on this subject.  Thanks alot!

I think it is important to clear up your first reply.  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are
correct re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,
you can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the
uncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with
Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your A,B and D drives.

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS
6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out
that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a
number of folks problems.

MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).

Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned
on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50, 
for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  I want to see
the MS spin doctors explain this.

Hello,

I want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows.
The most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing,
mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem
card on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk.

My idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All
three have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large
harddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to
the printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least:
Workgroups for Windows.

My questions:
- Is this possible?
- What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups
  for Windows?
- Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone
  is working.

Thanks,
Martijn

Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to ""print to a file"", with
output as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript file
to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the
document at 600 dots per inch resolution.

I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from
an image processing program that can output images in Postscript.

Here's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv)
doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driver
does have a pull-down menu for ""resolution"", but the only choice given in the
menu is 300!  Not a really useful menu.

Any ideas?

	I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell
network (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set
up to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say,
I'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network.

	Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but
several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd
mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and
perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS
apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live
without it.

	Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working
with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals
are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that
leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be
Norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself.

	As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've
read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd
like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.

	Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often.

Seen from a typographically point of view, ATM using PostScript fonts
is better than TrueType; the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is
gorgeous.
Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in
a PS font as problematically; they may have better use of the Unicode
features of TT fonts (in Windows NT).

I've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size PS fonts;
I haven't seen those as TT fonts. Most of them are rendering quite
inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts).
Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font; the first
looks better.

I am hoping that there will be ATM/NT !

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and
characters on each side, which is useless.

I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.
Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however!!

Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? 

Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF?

This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you
drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file
(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.

Is there a hot-key for the Windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  If not, is
there an easy way to create one?  The reason that I need one is that my
dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly
secure).  Also, the system manager won't let any software be added so 
another program such as LOCK32.ZIP from cica or a different screen saver
is out.

Thanks for any and all help.

Cliff, do you know the difference between ""Windows"" and ""Win-OS/2""?  Here's
a helpful hint:

Running ""Windows"" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS
box. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1
no longer has a ""real mode"".

The ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows
clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added
by IBM to ""Win-OS/2"".

Now, everybody who is running ""Windows"" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2
2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running ""Win-OS/2"" under OS/2,
raise YOUR hand.

Get the picture, Cliff?

Subject: Observation:  Floppy copy works under PGM MGR, but not DOS shell.
Organization: Motorola (Austin,TX)
Lines: 51
NNTP-Posting-Host: ome.sps.mot.com

Has anyone observed this?  If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP
file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5"") under MS Windows 3.1 via either
Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell 
has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not.

The corruption is detected by executing ""pkunzip -t b:\file.zip"" after 
both copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption.


Now here's the kicker:


I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps.
Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the 
DOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).


So, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running,
and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this 
scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows
apps and one slice for the running DOS app.  

When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks
are essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and
95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = 
.72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. 

When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell
(no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task
manager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice
(assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: 
(1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time.

So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU
time?  Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy 
copy?  It must be!



Miscellaneous data:  Running Windows on top of DOS 5.0, qemm 5.x, rapidbios.sys,

print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts. 
 
When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change 
the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.
 
I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates,
namely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs.
 
If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most 
chuffed.

Summary: Do We need SDK as well as DDK?
Keywords: SDK, windows



The Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) documentation (blurb)
states that the user must separately acquire the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK), which contains the Windows tools
to build the drivers. If we are using Borland C++ with Application
Frameworks, is this necessary? We also have a copy of the Microsoft
Press Programmer's Reference Library (books) which normally comes
with the SDK, and Microsoft Macro Assembler 6.0. Why is the SDK
neccessary for development of Virtual Device Drivers?

I have just upgraded from a Trident TVGA9000 to an ATI Graphics Ultra (the
old mach8 chip).  I am quite pleased with the performance so far, but have
one problem.  When using windows in 800x600, I have noticed that the 
tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when I
was using the Trident card.  Is there a setting in my .ini files that I can
change to make these smaller ?  I could not find the FAQ for this list...

I am having a really bothersome problem using the MSDOS prompt in Windows 3.1
to open a dos box.  When I am done with the dos box, I cant get back to windows.
If I do Alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goes
black and I have to control-alt-delete until I kill windows.  I get a couple
of screens about app not responding.

I think things are still alive under the black screen because if I alt-tab
to cycle through the running apps, I get flashes of text but then the
black returns.

This persists even if the machine is powered on and off.

I am working with an app developed using Borland's 3.1 application frameworks
and c++.  It seems to work fine.

Hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network.  Video is a TSENG 
vga.  dos 5.0.

I reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back.  I am
using temporary swapping for virtual memory.

I would really REALLY appreciate any hints anyone might offer.

Thanks,

You might look at one of the shell alternatives provided by third

Personally, I *like* File Manager, which comes with Windows.  It's much
faster than NDW's, and the File Manager that's part of Windows for
Workgroups even has a decent button bar.

That first you can do with File Manager, but the others you'll need

It does sound funny, I will admit.  But for me it is true.  Windows crashed on
all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception)
.  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  If windows works for you,
then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of 
choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each
task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the
key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it
would be more of an even fight.

The following three are not the competition for Windows 3.0 (IMHO of course)
System 7  -- Does not currently run on Intel boxes
NeXTSTep  -- Rather expensive should be a competitor to Windows NT not 3.x
Unix/X    --   ""        ""        ""    "" ""      ""     ""    ""     ""   ""   ""


With the exception of OS/2 all of the above will require most users
to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that
run under these OS's. And basically money speaks louder than anything
else. You keep saying ""More stable multitasking"" is what you mean
""Not Multi-finder / GEM / GeoWorks co-operative multi-tasking but

Basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for

Why pick it up? You stated the reasons behind your opinions. Stated them in 
a very straight-forward, though over protective, manner. And aside from
my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor, I think we are in
agreement.

Does Tim Glauert agree? Let's wait and see.

No, but...

You can allocate real static data within code segments!
When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap.

You can forget most of what was written about memory management. Under 3.1
you have paged virtual memory. You can lock every block without hampering
the memory manager. You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock/
Unlocking the memory block.

An besides: DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's, that happen to be called
by another task.

IT'S BACK!!!!!!

Congratulations, you've just discovered a very nasty, and very frequently
ecountered, bug in the Word Setup program. Once you know what is wrong, it
is quite easy to fix. Go into the Fonts dialog under Control Panel, and select
the two fonts MT Extra and Fences. Delete them, but only delete the list
entries, not the disk files. Now select Add, and add the fonts MT Extra Plain
and Fences Plain. Close the Font box, close Control Panel, and restart Word.
Everything should be alright now.

Does anyone know if Microsoft has fixed this thing yet? They HAVE to know
about it by now, it's been so frequently reported.

I'd like to get a system running OS/2 2.0 GA talking to a network of PCs
running Windows for Workgroups.  Acting as a server would be wonderful,
but client access would be enough.

Can I run WFW 's NET utilities in a DOS box?  Or is there a way to actually
get OS/2 to talk to WFW?  Will OS/2 LanMan clients talk to WFW?

I know that there is a list of the best shareware and public domain

updated every month.  Is it still being updated?  Does anyone else
compile a similar list?
 
Also are there any individual suggestions as to what the best

But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete
a tree - it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete
some files!  It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car.

By deliberately crippling the product?  Surely no...

Oh, hold on, I guess you're right.  That certainly stinks of MicroSoft
marketing techniques.

But the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new
technology, and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long
before Windows was even dreamt of.

Well Amen to that, but I wish it were a damn sight deader.  For a dead
product, its used an awful lot.  And I suspect its going to carry on
twitching for a long while yet, which isn't doing anyone any good.

(And MicroSoft don't appear to have given up marketing DOS, so it is a very
unusual form of death indeed).

I'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs.  A
couple of issues ago, PC Mag listed as Editor's Choices both Conversion
Artist and Hijaak for Windows.  Anyone have any experience with those or
some others?  I'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and
I'm not making much progress with the screen shots.  :^(
 
I'm currently using DoDot and I'm about to burn it and the disks it rode
it on.  It's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving
me crazy.  Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a
TIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left
and right sides of the picture [!].  Usually it confines itself to not
copying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for
editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.
 
The one nice thing it has, though, is it's ""dither"" option.  You'd think
that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,
256 colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W,
you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which
turn to white.  For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays on
buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the
3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.
 
If you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less
buggy!) program can do this as well?
 
Much thanks for any help.

PaintShop Pro for Windows is a fantastic product.  It can handle TIFF, GIF,
BMP, PCX, and many other formats, displaying them and converting between
them.  There is a shareware version of the program; I assume it's available
in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations (I'd try
ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  Log in as ftp, use your username as a password,
and look for a program called PSP101.exe or something like that.  I have
the registered version, and the only major difference I can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it.

Once again, FANTASTIC software.  Up to 24 bits, huge images, everything.

You bet your bippy it's built like a tank.. and not just mechanically either!

This past weekend we had a nasty thunderstorm and the impossible (*&^%)

floor outlet box into which my faithful DeskJet 500C was connected. There
was a .303-bullet-sized hole in the aluminum siding with some solidified
aluminum slag dripping from it. You could actually see the electrical box
through the hole! The outlet itself was fried and I'm still amazed the
whole damn house didn't burn down.

I lost 2 electric garage door openers,  2 vcr's, 2 telephones (all of which
were on the opposite side of the house), a ZyXEL U-1496E high speed modem,
a VGA monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the RS232 and parallel ports on my
X terminal and a WD LAN card in my PC. Not a good night!

But, the DeskJet ran as soon as I found a functioning serial and parallel
port to connect to it.

OK, now you are starting to define your criteria.

I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that.  You have shown that some
aspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems.  As I said
earlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true.
But some aspects of MSW3.1 are actually technically superior to each of the
other systems (resource requirements, performace, device support, printer
support, GUI etc.)

[ BTW, I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIX/X is as easy to
  learn as Windows! ]

But I might even agree that, on balance, MSW3.1 is technically inferior to
some of the competition. This still does not prove your point.

Range of available applications? Base OS cost? Cost of applications? Cost

Documentation?

If you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on
an OS, or indeed the primary factor, you need to think again.

Hmm...has anyone of us computer geeks (me included) ever consider
that inovation is not limited to software/hardware.  True, MS
products do not boast features that MS invented, but how many products
out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in
their continuing development? 

I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing.
It is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature(s) in thier GUI
that are better than MS.  But people like me can't afford them.
It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..
but they are just that...low end.  System 7 is a better operating
system, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for
my tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the common
user to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things 
do) and they either puke or faint.  

If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  But
for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware
that it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..

Oh yea, I guess the fact that the support products and applications
they have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too..

Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing
what it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright
and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and
other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to
be one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in
like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,
marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all
that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since
they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the
Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over
antitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who
have a great idea, yet get it ""borrowed"" by larger corporations who
can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from
the original innovator, I feel much sympathy.

In fact, I'm looking for a possibility to connect different peaces of information
(like in the windows help system). 

And no, I don't want to program such a system by myself. The necessary effort and
afford should be as small as possible.

Thanx in advance,   Thomas!

Are you sure you want to do that?  If a win app locks up for some reason, 
ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.  
Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion.
I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke.  Just a 
thought.

Take a look at WinQVT/net -- the latest version is QVT/net 3.4
It comes in versions that are direct to packet driver, as well as a PC NFS 
version.

It is priced quite low; registration = $40, student registration = $20, and is 
a nice package -- comes complete with VT220 terminal emulation, FTP, POP3 
client, LPR, and NNTP client.

You can FTP it from ""biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu"" /pub/qvtnet/qvtnet34.zip

It was also uploaded to ftp.cica.indiana.edu recently.

Microsoft is the largest software company on the planet, yet I cannot think
of even *ONE* computing concept that they innovated and brought to market
before anyone else.  Xerox-PARC/Apple, Osborne, NeXT, GNU and others have 
been pioneers and led the way to the future of computing.  What has
microsoft done to be a technological leader?  I posted this question before,
but I got nary a reply.  I make the challenge now to anyone who can come up
with something-especially Microsoft employees.  I get no response this time,
I guess it pretty much assures me that there is none--which is what I
suspect anyway.

I am running Windows 3.1 on a 386SX-16 MHZ with Five Megs of Memory.

The motherboard came with one meg, and I added the four megs this past
weekend.  They were 1X9 70 Simms.

I had installed in the application menu MS-DOS command PARK.  Up till
today, it parked the disk from the application menu without any problem.

When attempting to park the heads today, I received the following
message:


STOP        This application has violated system integrity due to
            an invalid general protection fault and will be
            terminated.

What does this message mean?

Thanks,

This pretty much confirms my original impression after reading
through the documentation on dos-6.  The double space sounds nice,
but NOT on your primary disk!!  I'll probably wind up making a
disk partition d: and doublespacing *it*, using it as an archive.
Probably would be useful on floppy disks as well.  But on c:?  Uh, uh...

[I particularly disliked the note that said something like ""double
space is irreversible""].
